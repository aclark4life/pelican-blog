Plone is the ultimate open source enterprise CMS. Understanding Plock To understand Plock you must understand a few things: The complexity of the Plone stack [1] . My desire to simplify, clarify and reduce-to-bare-elements everything I touch. My willingness to mask complexity when eliminating it is not possible, despite the risk of contributing to it. Pyramid author Chris McDonough [2] once made a comment a long time ago to the effect: \"Let's stop piling more crap on top of Plone\" and that sentiment still resonates today. That's why even though I love small and useful tools like Plock, it pains me to know what Plock is doing \"under the hood\" [7] . Nevertheless, I felt compelled to write it and make it work well because not having it is even more painful. Before I tell you what Plock is [8] , let me briefly describe what Plone is. What is Plone, really? What is the complexity I mention above? Briefly, with as few loaded statements as possible: Zope2 \"application server\". This is something you can pip install but the results will not be usable [3] . Zope2 add-ons AKA \"products\", most notably the Zope2 Content Management Framework (CMF). This is something you install on top of Zope2 (conceptually but not literally, pip install Products.CMFCore ) that provides typical content management features e.g. personalization, workflow, cataloging, etc. Zope3 technologies e.g. the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA). These are things that are included-or-integrated with Zope2 and Plone. [4] Buildout technologies e.g. setuptools, console scripts, recipes, extensions, etc. You can't easily build Plone without them, so we may as well declare them as dependencies. Plone technologies. Plone was originally known as a \"skin for CMF\" but has become much more than that. Archetypes Legacy content type framework. Dexterity Modern content type framework based on modern Zope concepts e.g. \"Reuse over reinvention\". Diazo Modern theming engine based on XSLT that \"maps Plone content to generic website themes.\" In total, if you pip install Plone over 200 Python packages are installed [5] . What is Plock, really? OK now it's time to explain Plock. Plock is something: you install from PyPI via pip install plock . \"Pip installs packages. Plock installs Plone.\" you use to install Plone without having to know about tarballs or Buildout. you use to install Plone add-ons without having to know about Buildout. In one sentence: Plock runs Buildout so you don't have to, at least initially. First steps with Plock Step #1 The first step with Plock [9] is that light bulb moment when you say to yourself: \"I've heard that Plone is the ultimate open source enterprise CMS and I'd love to try it!\" But you aren't willing to download a compressed archive and run the installer nor are you willing to pip install zc.buildout and figure the rest out for yourself. Enter Plock. Step #2 The second step with Plock is knowing that it exists you can install it with: pip install plock . Step #3 The third step with Plock is using it to install Plone: $ plock plone Creating virtualenv... (plone) Installing buildout... Downloading installer (https://launchpad.net/plone/4.3/4.3.4/+download/Plone-4.3.4-r1-UnifiedInstaller.tgz) Unpacking installer... Unpacking cache... Installing eggs... Installing cmmi & dist... Configuring cache... Running buildout... Done, now run: plone/bin/plone fg Now Plock's work is done; visit the following URL: http:://localhost:8080 and you should see: Create a Plone site: Start using Plone: Next steps with Plock Plock is more than just a way to install the latest stable version of Plone quickly and easily. It's also a way to find and install Plone add-ons quickly and easily, and a way to install almost any version of Plone including the upcoming Plone 5 release. Installing Add-ons Step #1 List all Plone-related packages on PyPI: $ plock -l 1) 73.unlockItems - A small tool for unlocking web_dav locked item in a plone portal. 2) actionbar.panel - Provides a (old) facebook style action panel at the bottom of your Plone site 3) adi.init - Deletes Plone's default contents 4) adi.samplecontent - Deletes Plone's default content and adds some sample content 5) adi.slickstyle - A slick style for Plone portals, easily extendable for your own styles. 6) affinitic.simplecookiecuttr - Basic integration of jquery.cookiecuttr.js for Plone 3 7) anthill.querytool - GUI for AdvancedQuery with some extensions - searching the easy way for Plone 8) anthill.skinner - Skinning for plone made easy 9) anz.dashboard - Plone netvibes like dashboard implementation 10) anz.ijabbar - Integrate iJab(an open source XMPP web chat client recommended by xmpp.org) to your plone site. … 1,352) zopeskel.diazotheme - Paster templates for Plone Diazo theme package 1,353) zopeskel.niteoweb - Paster templates for standard NiteoWeb Plone projects 1,354) zopyx.ecardsng - An ECard implementation for Plone 1,355) zopyx.existdb - Plone-ExistDB integration 1,356) zopyx.ipsumplone - Lorem ipsum text and image demo content for Plone 1,357) zopyx.multieventcalendar - A multi-event calendar for Plone 3.X 1,358) zopyx.plone.cassandra - Show all assigned local roles within a subtree for any Plone 4 site 1,359) zopyx.plone.migration - Export/import scripts for migration Plone 2+3 to Plone 4 1,360) zopyx.smartprintng.plone - Produce & Publisher server integration with Plone 1,361) zopyx.together - Plone integration with together.js Step #2 Note Plock currently only supports the initial creation of buildout.cfg , so if you have already run plock once and you want to install add-ons you'll have to use -f to overwrite buildout.cfg . Pick a few interesting things and install them: $ plock plone -i \"Products.PloneFormGen collective.plonetruegallery eea.facetednavigation\" Creating virtualenv... (plone) Installing buildout... Downloading installer (https://launchpad.net/plone/4.3/4.3.4/+download/Plone-4.3.4-r1-UnifiedInstaller.tgz) Unpacking installer... Unpacking cache... Installing eggs... Installing cmmi & dist... Configuring cache... Installing addons... - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PloneFormGen - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.plonetruegallery - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eea.facetednavigation Running buildout... Done, now run: plone/bin/plone fg Now you should see your add-ons available in Plone: Upgrading Plone Step #1 Realize Plock has created a buildout.cfg file you can edit with a text editor. Step #2 Also realize Plock hosts Buildout configuration files called Pins you can extend from your local buildout.cfg file [10] . Step #3 Edit your buildout.cfg file. Change the first extends URL from: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-4-3 # https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/dev To: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-5-0 # https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/dev Run Buildout and start Plone: $ bin/buildout $ bin/plone fg Enjoy the Plone 5 running man: TL;DR Cut and paste this into a terminal: pip install plock; plock plone; plone/bin/plone fg Now open http://localhost:8080 and happy Ploning. Plock 0.3.0 is out! Install with pip install plock and report issues here: https://github.com/plock/plock/issues . Footnotes [1] Whether or not dealing with that complexity is \"worth it\" I will not address here. Suffice it to say people still use and care about Plone and with Plone 5 coming \"real soon now\" there is some excitement building. [2] He probably made it many times, and rightfully so. [3] You can create an \"instance\" after pip install zope2 with bin/mkzopeinstance but $INSTANCE/bin/runzope fails with ImportError: cannot import name _error_start probably due to mismanaged package versions. Maybe we can fix this with version specs included in a dummy package's setup.py ? [4] The integration is not seemless, an undisputed fact as far as I know. [5] 235 [7] Creating and executing a buildout.cfg file for the end user. Buildout configuration files are written in INI-style text. Ideally the end user sees this file and says \"Ah, now I understand how this works.\" [8] I've also covered Plock before here . [9] As someone familiar with Python and a UNIX shell already, because that is the market I like to serve. [10] Yes, there is a security and/or reliability issue with doing this; you are clearly trading security and reliability for convenience.","tags":"Blog","title":"Plock Rocks"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2015/04/05/pillow-2015-report/","text":"Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors.

The most meaningful labels designate \"needs code review or tests\" or \"bug or enhancement\" or \"question\". Pull Requests All mergable pull requests were merged just prior to the 2.8.0 release. Of the remaining open pull requests, most need code review and the rest are experimental or in progress.

But there is something about the current proliferation of homework questions on /r/Python that I find offensive. Perhaps it is due to: 1.) Less meaningful content. I read /r/Python for Hacker News-like stories about Python. The more poorly written homework questions, the less meaningful content. 2.) No prior meaningful attempt to resolve the issue. E.g. \"Ive tried looking online, but to no avail [sic].\" What did you try? How did that attempt fail? So now I feel compelled to try and discourage such posts and encourage more meaningful posts .

This overview is roughly in order of development from start to finish. And since I am a \"packaging guy\", I will take this opportunity to comment on miscellaneous packaging issues too . Same theme, different backend The Pyramid version of aclark.net was almost two years old and needed an overhaul. Django appeared attractive because: I know Django, but I don't know enough Django. Like with Pyramid and Plone before, I learned a lot of Django while developing this site over the last few weeks. There was no \"content\" with the previous (Pyramid) site. The idea of putting my \"content\" in Django models was appealing to me. The new Django project website is awesome! An awesome website makes me want to build another awesome website with an awesome web framework. Awesome. I hate code generators I typically hate using code generators, full stop. But somehow Django's startproject and startapp don't make me want to vomit. So I used them in an organic [1] way, to make some obnoxiously long package names , and I miraculously don't hate the results! This can only mean: I am more tolerant of boilerplate code when learning a new framework, and/or: The process of creating the boilerplate code and the resulting boilerplate are so elegant/minimalistic that my insatiable desire for elegance/minimalism is at least partially satisified. No Postgres? No problem The idea of having to develop locally with Postgresql (or some other \"real\" database) feels \"heavy\" to me. With sqlite, I don't have to worry about database setup until I'm ready to worry about database setup [2] . I even pushed to Heroku with the sqlite database checked in, until I was ready to deploy Postgres. And I still use sqlite locally. Bootstrap all the things Sure Bootstrap is ubiquitious now, but it remains attractive nonetheless. One of the first tasks I performed was add django-admin-bootstrapped to my INSTALLED_APPS [3] . And because it's 2015, I Bower-installed Bootstrap and Fontawesome for my theme development. Make like a tree and file Lately I've gotten into the habit of using good-ol' Make to automate various tasks [4] . This project was no exception: dump: curl -o latest.dump `heroku pgbackups:url` push: git push git push heroku master sync: heroku run python aclarknet/manage.py syncdb publish: git commit -a -m \"Update\" Add-ons, Apps, Eggs, Distributions, Packages, Products, Wheels I am literally annoyed by the figurative abomination that is Python packaging terminology. The proliferation of terms is understandable though because of the many layers of technology , each with its own terminology , that may or may not overlap: The Python language Various packaging frameworks Software written in Python And all of that was just so I could tell you I pip-installed the following: Django Pillow django-admin-bootstrapped django-cumulus dj-database-url dj-static gunicorn psycopg2 -e aclarknet Buildout, Conda, easy_install, pip On a related subject, why do I have a setup.py ? I get the feeling that Django projects in the wild sometimes have one and sometimes don't. And the Django documentation has only a few mentions of setup.py . So why do I have one? In short, because I want my code in sys.path . I have another feeling that when Django projects/apps/etc don't have setup.py files, they are somehow manipulating sys.path manually to include themselves. There is slightly more mentioning of sys.path in Django's documentation, at least. Anyway, I use setup.py because I'm familiar with setuptools. Contact Form Enough packaging rants, back to the rest of the Django story. Every business website needs a contact form, right? And contact forms are tedious and boring to create, right? Yes and yes. That's why I thought using django-contact-form would be a good idea. Unfortunately I ran into an issue I couldn't easily work around, so I gave up and made my own [5] . ORM I really on my own? That's right. After adding an ImageField I expected the image to be stored in the database and not the file system, and I'm not ashamed. Since that was not the case, I ended up using django-cumulus [6] . Overall Overall, this was a great experience. As such, I'm now considering another pythonpackages.com reboot with Django; to further exercise my Django chops and fullfill the packaging-automation-vision I've had since late 2011. Please let me know your reaction to my experiences in the comments. [1] django-admin startproject aclarknet; cd aclarknet/aclarknet; django-admin startapp aclarknet [2] Granted, the perceived heaviness is much worse than the actual burden of \"real\" database setup which is admittedly fairly trivial: brew install postgres . [3] The Django admin without Bootstrap reminds me of the ZMI without Bootstrap, which I also don't like . [4] Embarrassingly, I create the tabs with s/ /\\t/ because my tabstop is set to 4 spaces. Maybe I should be change my tabstop setting each time? [5] Something to do with Sendgrid integration, certainly not django-contact-form's fault! [6] Which is another story. First I tried django-storages only to discover Rackspace Cloud Files support moved to cumulus (or started in cumulus and moved back?) Then django-cumulus almost worked but not quite. Rackspace Cloud Files returned a URL but upload failed. So I manually uploaded all the files to Rackspace Cloud Files as a workaround.","tags":"Blog","title":"New Django Website"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2015/01/05/packt-is-having-a-sale/","text":"Happy new year!

It is also too short. I may do a followup blog entry to review more features, depending on how well this one is received. I also want to talk more about Plock. When Plone 4 alpha 1 was released, I was so excited I immediately ran it in production . Now-a-days I use Pyramid for aclark.net but I still get excited about new Plone releases. As such, I finally got around to testing the latest Plone 5 alpha with my deployment stack and the results were very impressive, so I thought I'd share. Hosted configuration Because of the \"muscle memory\" I've built up over the years doing this, I always install Plone in development and production via my hosted configuration files . If you are not a developer you may instead prefer the Unified Installer, VirtualBox/Vagrant installer or OS X Lion/Mountain Lion/Mavericks Binary Installer otherwise follow along [1] : $ pip install tmp virtualenv $ cd `tmp` $ virtualenv . $ bin/pip install zc.buildout $ bin/buildout init Edit buildout.cfg to contain: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-5-0 Run Buildout and start Plone: $ bin/buildout $ bin/plone fg Create Plone Site The first thing you will notice is the improved \"Create a Plone Site\" page which now includes a timezone configuration option: Barceloneta Theme I selected the US/Eastern timezone and clicked Create Plone Site , shortly after which I was greeted with a beautiful new Plone 5 site in all its open source glory. Immediately you will notice a new theme and toolbar: Plone Toolbar Here is a quick tour of the new toolbar. Folder contents Edit button Sharing settings Workflow settings Add content Layout settings User menu Love it! Of all these, only the eye icon didn't function as expected. Not sure what it's supposed to do but I assume it's not done yet. Additionally, I wish the small Plone logo in the toolbar navigated \"home\" like the portal logo. Or maybe it will close the toolbar? Oh, the possibilities! Thanks Many thanks to everyone who has worked hard to make Plone 5 a reality. You should probably hire me or follow me on Twitter or both .

Matplotlib Plotting Cookbook by Alexandre Devert and asked to review it. Thanks PACKT! Here is my review. Preface But first, I'll mention I've worked on two projects recently that involved rendering matplotlib graphs directly to the browser i.e. via content-type: image/png. This is fun! It's particularly enjoyable when you are trying to avoid performing the task \"the right way\", which is arguably outputting JSON to some JavaScript graphing library e.g. Highcharts . The dependencies are heavy i.e. pip install numpy, etc. but not that heavy and once they are installed, your web application can output graphs rivaling those produced by JavaScript, all written in Python [1] . Highly recommended! Chapter 1 I think the code examples in Chapter 1 alone are worth the price of admission. Here is a video of me walking through the Chapter 1 code examples: You'll notice the typical fare here: bar, line and pie graphs along with some more complex boxplot, histogram, horizontal bar, scatter and triangle graphs, all in various colors. For reference, here are the excerpted commands called to produce these graphs: Chapter 2 Chapter 2 is all about customization e.g. via matplotlibrc. Here is a video of me walking through the Chapter 2 code examples: For reference, here is the sample matplotlibrc included with the matplotlib distribution (lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc): As you can see, there are a lot of knobs you can turn here. Chapter 3 Chapter 3 is all about \"annotations\". Here is a video of me walking through the Chapter 3 code examples: \"Annotations\" includes related topics such as adding shapes and controlling tick spacing and labeling. Chapter 4 Chapter 4 is all about \"working with figures\". Here is a video of me walking through the Chapter 4 code examples: \"Working with figures\" includes obvious topics like subplot and less obvious topics like setting the aspect ratio. Chapter 5 Chapter 5 is all about \"working with file output\". For reference, here are some of the images produced by the examples in this chapter (I wrote jpg files instead of png files due to a problem with my libpng: RuntimeError: Could not create write struct .) Also covered in this chapter is pdf output . Chapter 6 Chapter 6 is all about \"working with maps\". This chapter also introduces the imshow command . Chapter 7 Chapter 7 is all about \"working with 3D figures\". For reference, here are the excerpted commands called to produce these graphs: Chapter 8 Chapter 8 is all about working with the \"user interface\" interactively. Additionally, all of the popular graphical windowing environments are discussed: Tkinter, wxWidgets, GTK, Pyglet (three out of four of which I was able to install; GTK 2 vs GTK 3 confused me and I ran out of time debugging it . Conclusion Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend buying it . ( You should probably hire me or follow me on Twitter or both . And speaking of PACKT, you should definitely buy my book too .)

In Plone-land, we deliver the best Python-based CMS money can't buy on top of an aging Zope 2 \"application server\" mixed with newer Zope, Python, and other technologies. In short, this is a challenge. Diazo Further to the point, I think about \"new tech\" vs \"old tech\" a lot and how to happily marry the two. Here is one concrete example of my thought process. Diazo is the \"new theming engine\" in Plone which allows folks to perform complex XSLT transformations via a simple XML rule set. It sounds great, and it often is. But something won't let my mind reach the \"Ahhhh this is great technology!\" point. Instead, I often find myself thinking \"This is great technology, BUT…\" which I don't want to think when I'm thinking about Plone. Pioneering However I'm beginning to settle on an \"acceptable thought process\", to describe how Diazo fits on top of 10 years of legacy Plone technology: it's pioneering . As I have observed over the years, Plone developers have taken great pride in being the \"first to market\" with cutting edge and useful CMS features other vendors would love to include in their product. But are other CMS vendors watching? Issues Of issue with Diazo is: Most web developers are familiar with the concept of editing templates to affect output (AKA \"customization\"). When Zope 2 was young, the only place to easily customize templates was within the web application itself, with changes persisted to the ZODB. Then \"ZODB dread\" [1] happened and folks began to customize templates on the file system with software version control in place. During this time, customizations happened on the file system via the CMF framework built on top of Zope 2. Then Zope 3 happened and folks began to customize templates on the file system with more modern web technology (AKA \"pseudo-MVC-like environments\"). Then Deliverance [2] happened and folks began to leave the complex stack alone in favor of using XSLT transforms to produce a hybrid output containing both clean, isolated HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Plone content (AKA \"lipstick on a pig\"). Plone now has two distinct templating environments : the application environment which still has plenty of templates to customize & the theming environment which also has templates to customize. This is both good and bad: it's good when everyone can easily figure out where to customize what they want to customize, and bad when this process breaks down. Diazo allows for some complex rules to be written along with custom XSLT. That power allows folks to produce some truly unwieldy and wholly unmaintainable messes, for lack of a better description. I'm sad to say I've seen many of these in the wild, in just the few short years Diazo has existed. Conclusion After all this thinking, I've reached the following conclusion(s): The concept of editing templates most web developers are familiar with is still valid in Plone. But we must work harder to demonstrate where and how these customizations can occur. With great tools comes great power, but not without significant risk of injury (the so-called \"power tool\" analogy.) We should strive for the appearance of one templating environment. The easiest way to do this is to have only one templating environment. Many electronic flames have been burned over the discussion of making Diazo that single environment. In the meantime let's disassemble, polish & reassemble all of our templating environments and put effort in to making the difference between them seemless. ( zope2_bootstrap anyone?) We should actively discourage complex rules and custom XSLT . Of course, these knobs are nice to turn when you need them. But I don't want to read through complex rules and custom XSLT anymore than I want to see inline JavaScript or CSS. (AKA \"This is why we can't have nice things.\") And other CMS vendors should be watching, because Plone 5 is about to drop! ( You should probably hire me or follow me on Twitter or both .) [1] The fear all your hard work and customizations are trapped inside an unwieldy ZODB, with no easy way to persist or track them elsewhere.

I've just updated it in order to: Change the wording Update the links Add some comments What's changed? As change in technology is constant, you can expect a few details to differ between then and now. Though I generally don't like the term \"best practice\" I do like to write about \"how I do it now\" vs \"how I did it then\". Buildout Since \"Hello, Plone!\" was published Buildout 2.0.0 was released and Buildout has given up on attempting to provide module isolation in the same way Virtualenv that does. Why? Virtualenv does it better. So if you want to isolate your development from a larger Python installation, use Virtualenv. I routinely use both Buildout and Virtualenv. Buildout hosting Ever since I wrote Plone 3.3 Site Administration I've been maintaining a collection of buildouts. Most recently, I've moved them to a project called Plock . You can also find a bunch of archived buildouts here: https://github.com/buildouts .

Then I got sidetracked with the next version of Plock lingering unreleased in master. With the holidays underway I had a chance to revisit Plock and discovered a few things: I still like the idea of Plock. I got carried away adding miscellaneous features to Plock, which only served to ruin the elegance of the idea. I particularly like the idea of moving my hosted configuration files from PythonPackages to Plock. They always felt out of place in PythonPackages but I didn't have a better place to put them until now. What is Plock? So what is Plock today? A Plone-installer for the Pip-loving crowd. That means someone with Python 2.7 and Pip should be able to install Plone in a matter of minutes with: pip install plock ; plock . A set of hosted configuration files for Plone called Plock Pins .

Add-on installations are cumulative, so: $ plock -a Products.PloneFormGen . $ plock -a collective.loremipsum . will result in a buildout.cfg file that looks like this: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-4-3 [plone] eggs = ${addon:packages} ${base:packages} Products.PloneFormGen collective.loremipsum Add-ons that don't install via Buildout will not break your installation e.g.: $ plock -a asdf . Plock is installing Plone............. error: buildout failed. When Buildout fails, Plock restores the previous working buildout.cfg for you.

I originally wanted to have pythonpackages.com rewritten with some tests before doing this. But that never happened. Some of it was private. The original repository had things like the database checked in to it which had users' names in it. There were also various and sundry account credentials and API keys that needed to be removed. It took some time and motivation to get all that done. I needed historical perspective which does not occur without the passage of time. The packaging landscape has totally changed for the better since I last worked on pythonpackages.com, and I'm now ready to put the past behind me and focus on the future. Why Now I managed to find some time thanks to the U.S. Government <cough> (Speaking of that: this would be a great time to hire me for any tasks you need done.

But rather than a traditional list-the-changelog-style-blog-entry, I thought I'd walk you through what you can do with Plock as of version 0.1.2. Install Plone Plock exists to the eliminate cognitive dissonance experienced by Python programmers who want to install Plone but don't want to think about installing Plone. Such folks can now type the following to install Plone 4.3 (inside an activated virtualenv of course): $ pip install plock $ plock Installing Plone.

Run Plone With Plock, you can truly run Plone because you are not running scripts with any of the following not-plone names: client, instance, zope. $ plone fg List add-ons One of the biggest attractions to using Plone is all the work on your new web project that has already been done for you. There are over 1,200 packages on PyPI with \"plone\" in either the description, keywords list, or summary. Some of these are part of the core, and some don't work with the latest release, but there are still a lot of add-ons available (I'm currently working on an accurate count.) $ plock -l Install add-ons With Plock, installing add-ons is done from the command line. Pick a Python package name and install-away: $ plock -i Products.PloneFormGen Installing Plone. This may take a while... done. Or pick two or more: $ plock -i Products.PloneFormGen collective.cover Installing Plone. This may take a while... done. (If you have already installed an add-on with Plock, you can preserve the currently installed list with -p . Otherwise, the add-ons installed are replaced with each new call to -i .) If you pick a bad one, Plock has your back: $ plock -i foo Installing Plone. This may take a while... error! In the above scenario, Plock restored your previous configuration before reporting the error and exiting.

It's been a while since I had the pleasure, so I thought I'd make some notes: for myself, the AI Team and anyone else interested in the process. Background Plone.org is one of the oldest Plone sites in existence , having been launched circa Plone 1 and upgraded in place ever since. It functions remarkably well, given #1. It's not without its issues, but all of them are manageable — for some value of manageable. It's often very time consuming to work on. Pre-Process The first step is always to get a local copy: $ git clone git@github.com:plone/Products.PloneOrg.git $ cd Products.PloneOrg $ cp buildout.cfg.in buildout.cfg Edit buildout.cfg to extend the database.cfg : [buildout] # Rename to buildout.cfg and uncomment one of the profiles below extends = # Plone only, unthemed # conf/develop.cfg # Copy data local (with plone.org account) conf/database.cfg # Production (for use on plone.org server) # conf/production.cfg # Staging (for use on plone.org server) # and Deployment (for use by Jenkins, admins and developers), # fabric can be added to any of primary configurations # conf/staging.cfg # conf/fabric.cfg # Developer Database Drop; makes developer-friendly copies # of plone.org's content. # conf/devdrop.cfg Bootstrap and run Buildout: $ virtualenv-2.7 . $ bin/pip install zc.buildout $ bin/buildout Make the appropriate configuration changes i.e. change extends from 4.2 to 4.3: [buildout] develop = . extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.3.1/versions.cfg versions.cfg sources.cfg extensions = # buildout.dumppickedversions buildout.threatlevel mr.developer versions = versions sources-dir = sources eggs = Pillow Products.PloneOrg Products.PloneHotfix20130618 # get us a user and group variable [env] recipe = gocept.recipe.env [grp] recipe = collective.recipe.grp Run the upgrade locally. With plone.org data this takes about 45 minutes to an hour [1] . If the upgrade succeeds, you are ready to launch. If it fails, fix the errors before proceeding. Process We know from upgrading locally that the process will take about 45 minutes to an hour, so you should allocate about 2 hours to do the upgrade . Announce the upgrade: preferably a week or two in advance. The plone-developers and plone-users lists are probably sufficient, but you can create a plone.org news item too if you are feeling extra-ambitious. I only had a small window to perform this maintenance, so I skipped this step and proceeded directly to the next one. Add a status message to plone.org to indicate a maintenance window is in progress. I chose to customize the main_template to accomplish this, but ideally we'd have some functionality in Plone that allowed site administrators to easily configure status messages. Disable logins. Since the upgrade takes a long time, we don't want content being edited during this process. I chose to use David Glick's technique of disabling PAS. I moved the ldap authentication plugin to the Active Plugin list, thus disabling PAS such that only ZODB users could login. But ideally we'd have some feature in Plone to allow site administrators to disable logins. Run the upgrade. I forgot to mention earlier something very important: On plone.org, you can't access Zope from the internet. And you can't run the upgrade without accessing Zope. Hence run the following command to access the server, then access Plone via http://localhost:8080 : $ ssh -L 8080:10.57.0.107:5011 direct.plone.org After the upgrade finishes, click around to make sure you didn't break anything. In my case, I broke something — I normally move portal_skins/custom out of the way before upgrading, but this time I forgot. And when I experienced minor JavaScript issues, I forgot to examine custom; which currently looks like this: Even if I had remembered, I didn't want to spend the next few hours examining database customizations. Fortunately, before I realized I had forgotten to check custom, I emailed the plone-developers list — and Nathan Van Gheem to the rescue! He fixed some JavaScript in custom, then I cleared the cache(s). Ideally Plone would report on database customizations during the upgrade process: to indicate the potential for breakage and encourage the site administrator to round-trip those customizations back to the file system. Conclusion That's it! I hope this helps folks wrap their head around the plone.org upgrade process. A few closing thoughts: With Cloudflare in front, we probably don't need Varnish anymore. Leaving a note in portal_skins/custom to encourage folks to \"please keep this area clean\" — does not work. plone.com anyone? I don't know the future of plone.org and I have mixed feelings about it: on the one hand, I'm proud to help maintain such an old and venerable system. On the other hand, I think plone.org should be retired in a way similar to old.zope.org. What do you think? [1] It shouldn't take this long.

Nothing against Plone: it's still one of the greatest loves of my life (inasmuch as you can love a software and community, as I do). Why This was not the result of a revolutionary plan, rather more of an evolution. It happened like this: As soon as Plone 4.3a1 was released (a year ago?) I deployed a new Plone site to aclark.net with it, featuring a Diazo (new Plone theming engine) theme. Around the same time I became obsessed with deploying to Heroku, and also gained an interest in Python 3 . A few months ago, I got tired of paying $11/month to host my Plone site so I converted the site to static HTML and moved it to GitHub pages . But the result was flawed because maintenance involved editing duplicate copies of the website content (e.g. both clients.html and clients/foo.html contained the same text describing \"foo\"). So when it came time to do more than a few casual edits, I knew I had to find a new approach. That's when various elements of the Universe conspired to lead me in a new direction. How Pyramid I spent a lot of time (~ 1 year) developing pythonpackages.com in Pyramid, but the result was a mess (code-wise). I'm in the process of rewriting and open sourcing it, but it's slow going. So what better way to get started than to do a small-ish site in Pyramid for fun? about.me I also recently gave in and created an about.me site . I was impressed by their content editing features, and my ability to create a page that looked OK using them. In my about.me profile, I used a picture of me and a picture of DC I took in early 2012. When it came time to redo aclark.net I felt like I really wanted to capture the simplicity of the about.me site, so I used the same photo in the background. Bootstrap Bootstrap is old news at this point, but I really enjoy using it and I particularly like that they have added more example templates. So I combined my background photo with one of their example templates and a new site idea was born. As I'm not a particularly talented visual artist, my ability to produce something that looked OK (with code this time) was exciting. What Until I added a contact form, the site was entirely unremarkable. There are views and routes and templates, typical fare for a web framework. Here is the entire \"main routine\": from pyramid.session import UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig from pyramid.config import Configurator from .redir import blog from .redir import blog_entry from .redir import blog_slash from .views import contact from .views import default import deform_bootstrap def main(global_config, **settings): \"\"\" Oppan wsgi style!

Which lead me to wanting an elegant way to send mail via Heroku. Which lead me to discover SendGrid . Which lead me create some primitive marketing features I am quite proud of and excited about. I still ended up sending mail \"the old way\" via GMail. But now I send two mails: one to info@aclark.net to alert our staff about the lead (using GMail). And one to the lead acknowledging their submission (using SendGrid). SendGrid keeps a record of all the leads we've contacted, amongst other \"fancy marketing features\".

In that proposal, I presented the \"story of Pillow\" which I'd like to present again now, for anyone interested: Tired of seeing the proliferation of third party packagings of the Python Imaging Library, in 2010 Alex Clark took Hanno Schlicting's repackaging and used it to create a fork of the Python Imaging Library on GitHub. He subsequently released that fork to PyPI as Pillow 1.0. The ability to add additional development library paths to setup.py (e.g. 64 bit library and headers directories) and make releases quickly eventually led to widespread adoption of Pillow. A little over a year later on 2011-09-08, Takayuki Shimizukawa uploaded the first Windows (win32) eggs. Since then, every Pillow release included Windows eggs thanks to Takayuki. And on 2013-02-02, the first 64-bit Windows eggs (amd64) were uploaded to PyPI by Takayuki. For the first 3 years, the fork focused on packaging fixes only. Now a Python 3 compatible pull request from Brian Crowell has been merged, and the final stages of release preparation are underway. In early 2013, Barry Warsaw created an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive and tested it with Python 3. And the Fedora Project is now planning to include Pillow with their release of Fedora 19. Finally, the Pillow project has promised a Python 3 compatible release of Pillow by PyCon 2013. That release is now done! And I have had an absolute blast working on Pillow full time over the course of the last week or so. So much so, that I'm going to propose you help me continue to have fun and be productive with Pillow… but more on that later. First, about the new release. About 2.0.0 This release marks the first \"serious effort\" I have put into Pillow. While I've always enjoyed working on it in my spare time, I knew that there was no way I could finish it in time for PyCon 2013 (as I promised) without getting some financial assistance. Enter: The PSF, who graciously offered to fund my work (and the work of one other contributor). Once I had funding in place, I knew exactly what needed to be done: So much time has passed since the fork, no one seemed to care if we made image code changes (we were originally a packaging fork), so this release contains EVERY PATCH EVER SUBMITTED TO PIL but not released until now. I'm exaggerating, but we really crammed a lot of \"goodness\" in to the 2.0.0 release along with Python 3 support which is what prompted the release in the first place. In order to fully test, I fine-tuned my tox environment on Mac OS X (tox is awesome) as well as fired up a new Windows VM (and used an already-existing Linux VM). Additionally, other folks joined in to test on their environments (most notably Christophe Gohlke and Eric Soroos). You'll find the results here: https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow#platform-support . That means: THIS RELEASE HAS BEEN FULLY, EXTENSIVELY, AND EXHAUSTIVELY DEVELOPED AND TESTED . Aside from the possible inconvenience of Pillow 2.0.0 dropping 2.4 and 2.5 support (use Pillow 1.x if you need Python 2.4,2.5), you should not have any trouble with it. If you do, please open a ticket here: https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues . As important as quality software is to me, quality presentation is almost equally important. (That's developer-eye quality, not designer-eye quality. ;-)) So I spent a lot of time cleaning up and enhancing the more subtle aspects of the release e.g. README.rst, docs/* (including the pythondoc documentation and HISTORY.txt and CONTRIBUTORS.txt). The pythondoc documentation has been converted to re-structured text and is hosted on ReadTheDocs: http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ . The website has been updated to include an actual image generated by PIL :-) http://python-imaging.github.com/ . I hope you enjoy and use Pillow 2.0.0. If you'd like to see me continue to devote significant time to maintaining Pillow, please consider a gittip ! Thank you.","tags":"Blog","title":"The Story of Pillow"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2013/02/23/trading-places-trading-scene-explained/","text":"Every time I watch the movie Trading Places , I have to search the internet for an explanation of the climactic commodities trading scene. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to (re-)understand it, then another 10 minutes to explain it to my wife. Although there are plenty of great answers available, none of them really \"speak\" to me; so I decided to write my own. The goal for me is to be able to (re-)read my explanation and understand it enough to explain to someone else in less than 5 minutes. This scene is tricky for non-stockbrokers to understand because you need to know a lot about trading, and you also need to know some important plot details. Rather than continue to look everything up on the internet each time, I figured I'd write this blog entry instead. Important Plot Detail #1 The Crop Reports, real and fake. In the movie, the Dukes plan to cheat. But the \"good guys\" (Valentine and Winthrope) foil them by replacing their stolen, ill-gotten crop report with a fake. This allows the \"good guys\" to win. To understand the reverse-swindle, you must understand the crop reports (real and fake) and the market repercussions of each: Report (FAKE) Report (REAL) Weather BAD GOOD Harvest (i.e. # oranges) LOW HIGH Prices HIGH LOW Important Plot Detail #2 Remember, the Dukes plan to cheat AKA \"corner the market\" . And as Chris Carter says: The (Duke's) agent wants to own as many contracts as possible before the crop report is revealed, since (he thinks) once it is, the price will go up and he can sell at a profit. Trading begins with a price of 102 cents per pound, which translates into $15,300 per contract. Once everyone sees that the Dukes' agent is trying to corner the market, they all want a piece of it, forcing the price up since more people are buying than selling. I'll repeat that last part: when trading opens before the true crop report is revealed more people are buying than selling. Important Plot Detail #3 The \"good guys\" know the truth i.e. that the current buying trend is based on the Duke's actions which are based on false information. That brings us to another important point: the \"good guys\" realize an opportunity to \"sell short\" . Or as Chris Carter puts it: They are betting they will be able to buy the contracts later at a lower price so they come out making money but not holding any contracts at the end of trading. Light bulb Ding! Ding! Ding! So after all this, here's what's really happening: the \"good guys\" successfully carry out a short sale, with the help of the \"bad guys\" who are trying to corner the market but acting on false information . Or as Chris Carter puts it, after the real crop report is published: They (the \"good guys\") need to buy--a lot--to zero their position, and the crowd is more than willing to oblige. Finally, the \"good guys\" are able to buy enough to contracts to fulfill the number of \"short\" sales they made. And they are able to purchase them for much less then they made the \"short\" sales for. Profit! Does it make sense now? If not, let me know in the comments.","tags":"Blog","title":"Trading Places Trading Scene Explained"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2013/02/23/built-with-plone-powered-by-github-pages/","text":"Is Plone the next great static website generator?

And I'm very thankful to the folks who make my life easier, including the authors of: Python : Python Core Developers dotfiles : Jon Bernard checkoutmanager : Reinout Van Rees I also love repetition . So picture if you will, a new Macbook Air or Pro ready to serve as my development workstation. I like to perform, and study, the steps required to turn a new laptop in to my development workstation. So here we go. In this article, I will walk through the steps required to turn a new machine in to my developer workstation. Do follow along! Shell One of the first things I do on a new system is change my shell to Zsh in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Current User -> Right Click -> Advanced Options... . Don't forget to Click the lock to make changes first. Zsh Why Zsh ? One of my favorite features is shared history between open sessions . So I can run a command in one window, and then run the same command from another window by fetching it from the history (with CTRL-R). XCode After I take possession of my new laptop (running Mountain Lion , the newest OS X at the time of this writing), I head to the App Store to download XCode. [2] Among many other things, XCode gives me the GNU C Compiler and allows me to type \"gcc\" in my Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal . Python Now I need a Python interpreter [3] . For development I use the Collective Python Buildout but I also enjoy using Homebrew's Python 2.7. I use Homebrew for a variety of other things too (e.g. mobile-shell AKA mosh) so here we go: $ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\" … follow instructions … $ brew install python Git I think OS X (or XCode) includes git, but just in case: $ brew install git Which reminds me, don't forget that installing the command line utilities in Mountain Lion's XCode requires an additional step in Preferences -> Downloads -> Command Line Tools -> Install : Dotfiles At this point, I can begin to get serious about turning this new machine in to my developer workstation. And that means: installing my private ssh key so I can check out code without typing a password, of course. Normally this would be tedious, but with git and dotfiles it's not so bad. This is what I do from my home directory: $ git clone https://super_secret_url/dotfiles.git Dotfiles I use https which requires a password for the first time only. Then I edit Dotfiles/.git/config and change the repository URL to git@super_secret_url/dotfiles.git . So every subsequent pull and push will require no password. And to \"install\" these dotfiles, I do [6] : $ pip install dotfiles $ dotfiles -s --force Note: the dotfiles command finds my dotfiles in the default directory \"Dotfiles\" and create symbolic links to them. Distribute & Pip Homebrew's Python includes pip, but even if it didn't: $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py $ /usr/local/bin/python distribute_setup.py $ {easy_install, pip install} dotfiles In other words, you can always install Distribute [4] . After which you can use easy_install or pip to install dotfiles. (You can read up on the differences. TL;DR: neither is \"better\" or \"worse\", it's just a question of which tradeoffs you are willing to make. I tend to use pip just because it's newer and I like its requirements.txt feature, but easy_install is still very well supported as part of the Distribute project.) Checkoutmanager Now I need some things to develop. Since I work on a bunch of different projects, I need a way to keep track of what should be checked out at any given time. So I do this [5] : $ pip install checkoutmanager $ checkoutmanager co This creates and populates my ~/Developer directory with code. And it \"just works\" because I keep a .checkoutmanager.cfg in my Dotfiles repository.

And off we go: $ cd Developer/buildout.python $ python bootstrap.py Finally, there is some PATH configuration required to make all of this seemless. The Collective Python Buildout gets installed in /opt while brew's stuff is in /usr/local. My PATH config currently looks like this: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/Users/aclark/Developer/buildout.python/python-2.7/bin:$PATH export PATH=~/Developer/binfiles:/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH With the above configuration, I default to the Python 2.7 in the Collective Python Buildout. That means that is the \"python\" or \"virtualenv\" I get when I type those commands. I use the full path or expanded binary name when I need them e.g. /usr/local/bin/python or python3.3. That's it! I hope you will check out dotfiles and checkoutmanager for all your development needs. [1] Not really an ode: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode [2] I know about Kenneth Reitz's XCode Command line Tools only, but if I recall correctly there is some \"gotcha\" that has bitten me more than once if I use that instead of the full XCode. I wish I could remember what it was now, but it's not coming to me. If it works for you though, great! [3] I know about the system Python, and for small things like checkoutmanager and dotfiles I don't mind using it. But there is merit in avoiding it because Apple treats it like \"their\" Python and makes decisions for you that you may prefer to make yourself. E.g. I believe they use a crippled version of the readline library. [4] Distribute is a more actively maintained fork of the venerable setuptools library (which itself is built on top of the Python standard library's distutils). Are we having fun yet? [5] I also alias checkoutmanager to cm :-) [6] I force because I want to replace the newly created .ssh dir with the one I keep in my Dotfiles repository.

Starting with Plone in the early 2000s, to Django in the early 2010s, to now. And for this, I am very grateful. To be clear: it's not exactly the Open Source Work that has paid my bills, it's the consulting work I've been able to secure as a result of my dedication and devotion to open source software and communities. Which is great! (Even more clear: my dedication and devotion to open source software and communities has made learning new skills fun. And those skills have paid my bills for the past 8 years.) TL;DR: Open Source Work is awesome. I'll likely spend my entire life doing it (in some capacity or another). And while Open Source Work does not pay, the experience is invaluable. SaaS Offering Along the way, I caught the \"startup bug\" and have been interested in building a SaaS offering that would at least pay my bills, if not make me fantastically wealthy. Enter 2012's: pythonpackages.com . The year I spent doing pythonpackages.com work was awesome. I learned a lot. Traveled. Met a lot of cool folks who seemed genuinely interested in my idea(s). But unfortunately, I never made a dime doing it. The lesson, among others, is that SaaS offerings are hard . I am now semi-focused on a \"reboot\" of the pythonpackages.com idea(s), but that's going to take a while to get going. TL;DR: Consulting *was* the dream. Now building a SaaS offering *is* the dream (among others). So where does Open Source Work fit in? Play as Work I've been \"working for a living\" since age 14. Back then, I was a busboy and dishwasher in my family's Italian restaurant, where I first learned to work hard and have fun doing it . Since then, I've always worked hard, had fun, and taken few vacations (except for 1994-1998 when I was a full time CS student). I suspect I will always \"work for a living\" though as I get older, the line between work and play becomes even blurrier. Everyone wants to love or at least like their work. But very few are able to turn their play in to paid work. That's what I want to do. And I am very fortunate, I think, to know what I want to do in life. I know middle aged folk that still don't know the answer to that question. TL;DR: liking my work *was* the dream. Now turning the things I like to do into paid work *is* the dream. In 2013, I would like to spend more time doing Open Source Work, working on projects like Buildout , DC Python , Pillow , Plone , django-axes , et al .

Yes, Zope can be complex. But it's also useful. And full of \"been there, done that\" wisdom. Yes, the simple days of Plone Kitty are gone, but there are many great things ahead. Let's carry the best of the past forward into the future. I don't always state my intentions this explicitly: because that is no where near as fun for me. But I don't want folks to get the wrong impression either, so please help me get the message right if you can. As always, thanks for reading.","tags":"Blog","title":"About My Work"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2013/01/09/hello-plone-again/","text":"Regarding my recent \"Goodbye Plone\" post: It's come to my attention that the style of my departure post, and associated actions, may be perceived poorly. I'm sorry. This was not my intention, and I apologize if I've upset anyone. The Plone Community deserves the best, so let me see what I can do to address this. Several folks have reached out to express their concern about my departure, I appreciate this very much. While I stand behind my need to distance myself from such conflicts, I don't want to give the Plone Community or the outside world the wrong impression. So, let me say this: I'm thinking about what happened today, and I'm going to comment about it in the future. I.e. after 24 hours or so. Regardless of future updates, please consider me: \"around in some capacity, but not as fully engaged for personal reasons\" :-). This is an attempt to revert my abrubt departure, while at the same time not fully re-engaging until such time as I can determine the best course of action. Note that above all, and aside from my personal and professional goals, I don't want to be disruptive to the community if I can help it.

Plone Kitty is the name of a theme (then called \"skin\") that shipped with the earliest versions of Plone (1.1 in the image above). This was a simpler time when the web was new, and everything was possible! Today, we know that the web is hard . While everything is still possible, building the web requires a tremendous amount of hard work. But it doesn't have to be all drudgery. There is still quite a bit of fun to be had building the web, if you know where to look (in addition to all the unavoidable hard work). Enter: Plone. Both the web and Plone have changed drastically since The Plone Kitty once prowled the internet. And while the Plone Kitty is all but extinct, Plone lives on; continously modernizing itself to keep up with the fast pace of today's modern web. From the Plone Kitty website (now running on Heroku!): If you used Plone \"back in the day\" (early 2000s), please add a comment below about your experiences then. If you are new to Plone or just curious about it now, please add a comment below about your initial impressions.

Both to reflect on the current year and look back on previous years. So here it is. I did this in 2009 & 2011 . Let's try it again. 1. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2012? That would be Kenneth Reitz's Requests . Like many others, I've been bitten by the elegance and simplicity bug that is inherent and ingrained in the Requests library. Primarily, I used it to build pythonpackages.com. In particular, I used it to communicate with the almost-equally-elegant (IMHO) GitHub API. This is why I like requests (among other reasons): I don't need to use a \"third party\" library to communicate with the GitHub API. Such libraries (I think) attempt to make my job easier by hiding complexity and presenting simpler APIs to use. This is sometimes necessary, but no substitute for really and actually simple APIs and good documentation (both of which GitHub and Kenneth provide, with their respective APIs.) 2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012? JavaScript: check. Unit testing: check. These are techniques I have learned enough of to be effective in my \"day job\" (I'm self-employed). But I learned (finally) that I am primarily: a Python Web Developer. And it feels good to say that. I use Python, and related web technologies to build web applications for my clients. I typically only care to learn enough of a technology to get my job done, then I lose interest (for the most part). That's because I'm also a Hacker. I identify significantly with this monicker because it fits who I am and how I conduct myself professionally. I care about getting the job done above all else. And if there is a job to be done, my intellectual curiosity knows no bounds. If the job is done, I'm going to play guitar. So whatever the technique, I'll learn it if it's something I care about for whatever reason. 3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012 ? What did you do? This is the first year that Plone did not consume my every moment. I also spent significant time working on Buildout (INI-config-driven system to install Python packages and other software, & perform other related and miscellaneous tasks) and Pillow (PIL fork) . With the help of many others, I hope to get a Python 3.3 compatible release of Pillow out by PyCon 2013. And I'll support Buildout < 2.x until such time as Buildout 2.x goes mainstream. 4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012? Planets: Django, Mozilla, Plone, Python. Reddits: Python. Other feeds: Hacker News & Tech Crunch. I added Tech Crunch this year to satisfy my \"startup itch\", as was recommended to me by Jonathon Perrelli of Fortify.vc in DC. 5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013? How to hustle. Hustling, and more hustling. I've gained a lot (enough?) technical skill over the years. Now I want to put that skill to good use in business. I've managed to remain self-employed for a number of years, now I'd like to employ others full time, build successful businesses and otherwise \"expand my empire\". 6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013? I hope that I get more significant time to put into my \"baby\": pythonpackages.com . In particular, I'm considering adding a Travis-like service which would spawn Windows VMs to run tests and produce executables for Python packages (to address a particular pain point I've discovered along the way: people want to support Windows, but often don't have the ability to do so easily.)

I don't have any numbers handy, but I'm sure there is as much if not more activity going on in the Plone Community right now as there is in the White House \"reelection department\". Structure The Plone community consists (roughly) of Founders, Contributors, and Users. It has formalized itself into a 501(c)(3) organization with a corresponding board and membership. The board conducts business to \"protect and promote Plone\" on behalf of the community and the foundation members (but not necessarily board members) are all recognized contributors. Contributors control the speed and direction of the project. Some of the contributors are: Teams The Framework Team (arguably the most important team, next to the core developers themselves [0] .) Responsible for \"evaluating PLIPS for inclusion in Plone\". PLIPS are \"Plone Improvement Proposals\" used to convey the message: \"I want to add this feature to (or remove from) Plone core and I, or the others listed here, will do the work.\" The Documentation Team (arguably equally as important) Responsible for documenting the Plone software for developers and end users. The QA Team (arguably… oh hell they're all important) Responsible for making sure the software is suitable for consumption by developers and end users. The Marketing Team Responsible for promoting Plone to prospective consumers. The AI Team (Admin Infrastructure) [1] Responsible for maintaining software and systems infrastructure for the community. Internationalization Team Responsible for translating Plone's user interface text into multiple language. Security team Responsible for addressing complex security issues with Plone core software. And more… I'm sure I missed some teams, feel free to check out the entire list here: http://plone.org/team . Factions As is common in the world at large, the Plone community is comprised of various factions. From circles of friends, to the hundreds of Plone consulting firms, to the business sectors that embrace Plone (e.g. non-profits). These factions may never, in their lifetimes, interact with one another but they are critical to the success of Plone. (It would be a shame if they didn't, which is why we have the annual Plone Conference). Individuals Finally, we have the noteworthy individuals of the project. These include the Founders, Board Presidents, Release Managers, Core Developers, and more. Most especially this includes YOU . If you have contributed to the Plone project in any way large or small, your work is appreciated. Greatness What's great is that it all works. I am struck by how much the Plone Community is a microcosm of the world. Especially during election time in the United States, I've been thinking a lot about \"how the world works\" and I see the same patterns everywhere. Not everyone: Enjoys the same activities Shares the same beliefs Likes the same people Has the same goals But when you share a common goal e.g. Running a country, or a city, or a state, or business, or a community, or a project, you find ways to get along. Individuals work with other individuals, factions work with other factions, teams works with others teams, projects ship their product to the world. In this case, I'm looking forward to the Plone project shipping its product to the world for the next 10 years or more. Good luck to us all! Consider a <3 [0] I'm not listing the core developers because there are over 100 of them and they don't formally meet as far as I know. But of course, without the Founders and Core Developers none of us would be here. So a very special thanks to them as well.

It has formalized itself into a 501(c)(3) software foundation with a corresponding board and membership. The board conducts business on behalf of the community and the board and foundation members are all recognized contributors. Both the board and the membership have their own private mailing list. Issue Over the years, issues have been raised on the membership list that have led to more discussion than all of the foundation membership are comfortable with. And some have expressed that concern (usually without addressing the orginal concern or \"topic\" of the thread). Fix While I am quite confident that folks can manage their own INBOXES (or should be able to), I'm not confident that folks (myself included) can resist engaging with others over issues like: The \"religious\" aspect (The Plone community is better than this!) The practical aspect (Everyone can just control themselves!) The miscommunication (You are obviously \"wrong\" about XYZ which I won't address but rather suggest you stop!) To me, the fix is simple. Do the most practical thing and split the lists into: Membership-announce and Membership-discuss (note: discussions with the board list are a different matter.) This says nothing about the health of the community (which is strong), it just means: announce is for important information like \"please renew your foundation membership\" and discuss is for hashing out issues that foundation members care about. As someone who volunteers to help maintain the lists for the community, I don't take this suggestion lightly but I think it's the right thing to do to move forward and make the most number of people happy. That said, if a vote decides otherwise I am OK with that, but I'll be curbing the amount of discussion I would actually like to do on the membership list.","tags":"Blog","title":"Why Split The Lists"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2012/10/20/review-of-aspelis-professional-plone-4-development/","text":"I owe PACKT a review of this book, so here it is. First: I liked it. Second: I appreciate Aspeli writing it. Third: Like many others, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Fourth: I know that it was a TON OF WORK and PROBABLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY to write it. So why write a Plone book? A few reasons (other than money): It's good for you It's good for the community It's good for Plone So if you care about Plone: please go buy both an electronic and paper version of this book RIGHT NOW [0] . While you are at it, please pick up a copy of Plone 3.3 Site Administration . It's quite good, and I hear the author is a swell guy who would appreciate your generosity [1] [2] . What I like First let me cover what I ABSOLUTELY LOVE about this book. buildout:eggs Aspeli correctly addresses one of my biggest pet peeves (concerns) about what I believe to be an ANTI-PATTERN in almost every Plone buildout: buildout:eggs (referring to the eggs parameter of the buildout section; it does not exist, other than as a convenient variable setting). If you know me, you know I've spoken about this before and whilst I've moved on from harping on it I will say this: with most software that uses ini-style configuration files when you set a parameter you expect something to happen. But since Buildout is more complicated than the average software that uses ini-style configuration, that expectation is not always met. Add-ons Did you see? You might have missed it. No mention of Products WHAT-SO-EVER. \"Product\" was a term that Zope2 used for Python libraries that enhanced the functionality of Zope2, and it stuck. Now, it should die in favor of a term everyone else in the world is familiar with (in this context): add-on. Well played, Aspeli. Well played. The Review I will now talk about each chapter briefly. This will be TL;DR-style, but I hope you'll get a nice idea for why this book is so great. Every imaginable detail for each section is covered in the book in painstaking detail by Aspeli. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask them in the comments. Chapter 1: Plone in Context In which we learn what, why & when Plone is, plus a bit more. My favorite sub-section is: Plone-the-application and Plone-the-framework, in which Aspeli describes the phenomenon of Plone the application being used by some folks as a generic Python web framework. Plone's strengh and indeed its raison d'etre (reason to exist) is to provide a fully-featured CMS web application suitable for immediate use, or use immediately after a few simple customizations. So if you try to use it as a web framework, you may not get exactly what you expect (because it was not designed to be used that way). Chapter 2: Introduction to the Case Study In which we learn how a professional may execute a typical website project with Plone. This is a nice little chapter with some great details about the fictional project that will be executed throughout the remainder of the book: requirements, mockups, and information architecture are the highlights here; as well as the necessary CMS details like users, groups, and content types. Chapter 3: The Development Environment In which we learn about how to setup an environment in which you can customize Plone to suit your needs. TL;DR: fairly typical Python development environment [3] with additional Plone details covered: Buildout recipes, development libraries, and more. Chapter 4: Basics of Customization In which we learn about the technical architecture of Plone: ZODB, GenericSetup, Zope2 CMF, Zope Component Architecture, and more (!). And the best way to implement your requirements within that architecture. Chapter 5: Developing a Site Strategy In which we learn about how to bundle your customizations into a Python package for general use. Chapter 6: Security and Workflow In which we learn about how Plone implements generic web application features and how you can customize that implementation. Chapter 7: Using Add-ons In which we learn about how to add additional Python libraries to Plone to provide additional features. Chapter 8: Creating a Custom Theme In which we learn about Plone's new theming engine: Diazo. Chapter 9: Nine Core Concepts of Zope Programming In which learn a bit more about the technical architecture of Plone. If you love this chapter (as many do), you might also enjoy: http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/old/zope_secrets/index.html . Chapter 10: Custom Content Types In which we learn about Plone's new content type framework: Dexterity. Chapter 11: Standalone Views and Forms In which we learn about a topic that would be first, if Plone were a generic website framework: how to build forms. Chapter 12: Relational Databases In which we learn about how to integrate a relational database into your CMS application. Since Plone relies heavily on the ZODB, none is included by default. Chapter 13: Users and their Permissions In which we learn about another topic that would be covered first if Plone were a generic website framework: authentication and authorization. Chapter 14: Dynamic User Interfaces with jQuery In which we learn about using jQuery in Plone. Chapter 15: Summary and Potential Enhancements In which we learn about next steps. You've just built and delivered a CMS application for your client. What will they ask you for next? And how will you implement it. Conclusion I hope you have enjoyed this review; and I hope you'll consider purchasing a copy of Aspeli's book for your next Plone project. Like this article? Consider a gittip . You may also want to follow me on twitter . [0] Disclaimer: I was given a copy of both versions in exchange for this review. [1] Seriously though, whilst PACKT literally forces you to include a software version number in your title, Plone 3.3 Site Administration is still relevant to today's Plone. I expect it will be relevant through at least Plone 5. [2] The financial details of (at least) my contract for writing a book with PACKT CLEARLY FAVORED PACKT . That said, I think they are a great organization and I am proud to be a PACKT author. But according to my statements, I still need to earn about $1K more in royalties before I have paid back my advance. Notice what I just said there: earn in royalties i.e. I have to sell enough books in order to get PACKT to pay out enough money to meet the terms of the contract. I won't pretend to have any idea why PACKT does what it does with its contracts, except to say that I assume they expect to make money. I'll also assume everything is on the up and up. But unfortunately sometimes the \"up and up\" can look like this: http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121018/01054720744/hollywood-accounting-how-19-million-movie-makes-150-million-still-isnt-profitable.shtml .

And I have fond memories of interacting administratively with MajorDomo and ListServ software. And by administratively, I mean sending the software commands and getting back a response. In fact, you might say I get along better with the software and machines than I do with the humans that use them. Which is not to say that I'm not a people person: I love people. But I do struggle with striking the right balance between hacking machines and communicating with humans. Anyway, as you can imagine: I have VERY STRONG OPINIONS about how folks should conduct themselves on mailing lists: call it a code of conduct. And regardless of what you might expect from a self-described \"hack\": I work VERY HARD to enforce that code of conduct on my own behavior. Do I occasionally step outside the lines? Of course. But make no mistake: I do not communicate in a vacuum. You can be as polite and courteous as The Pope and STILL GET THE SMACKDOWN through no fault of your own. Why? Because humans make mistakes. Context gets lost. Do you think you know what's going on enough to make a comment? You might be wrong [2] : \"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\" — George Bernard Shaw quotes (Irish literary Critic, Playwright and Essayist. 1925 Nobel Prize for Literature, 1856-1950) Netiquette So what is a human to do? Well, guess what! There's actually a set of rules or, code of conduct, for humans to follow. Someone wrote it all down. And it's commonly referred to today as \"netiquette\". A quick glance at The Core Rules of Netiquette and you'll be well on your way to being a better electronic human than you were the day before. I say this as someone familiar with netiquette, but not as someone who has actually studied up on the concepts recently. One of my favorites: From Rule #1: Remember The Human: … \"When you're holding a conversation online -- whether it's an email exchange or a response to a discussion group posting -- it's easy to misinterpret your correspondent's meaning. And it's frighteningly easy to forget that your correspondent is a person with feelings more or less like your own. It's ironic, really. Computer networks bring people together who'd otherwise never meet. But the impersonality of the medium changes that meeting to something less -- well, less personal. Humans exchanging email often behave the way some people behind the wheel of a car do: They curse at other drivers, make obscene gestures, and generally behave like savages. Most of them would never act that way at work or at home. But the interposition of the machine seems to make it acceptable. The message of Netiquette is that it's not acceptable. Yes, use your network connections to express yourself freely, explore strange new worlds, and boldly go where you've never gone before. But remember the Prime Directive of Netiquette: Those are real people out there. Would you say it to the person's face? Writer and Macintosh evangelist Guy Kawasaki tells a story about getting email from some fellow he's never met. Online, this fellow tells Guy that he's a bad writer with nothing interesting to say. Unbelievably rude? Yes, but unfortunately, it happens all the time in cyberspace.\" … One belief that I've held for almost as long as I have been communicating electronically is: IF I SAY SOMETHING ELECTRONICALLY I PROBABLY MEAN IT . That means you can expect to hear the same information from me in person, as you would in an email or other electronic corresponence. That also means that I rarely look back and CRINGE and think to myself: \"Oh my gosh I can't believe I wrote that.\" Do I make mistakes? Of course. But less and less as I get older and older. More frequently than not, I stand 100% behind my electronic correspondence. Is netiquette enough? Netiquette covers almost everything you can think of. From trying to be sensitive to the context of the list (RULE #3 and #4) to helping guide the discussion the right way (RULE #7) to giving everyone the benefit of the doubt all the time (RULE #10). Still, sometimes CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN like someone forgets to mail the list directly and the direction of the membership \"forks\". Follow this thread to see me both issue a SMACKDOWN then APOLOGIZE when I realized I'd acted upon information only I and one other person was privy to. Policy makes perfect Sometimes, people will pop on to a list and say \"Is this the right place to ask about XYZ?\" Other times, they'll just ask it: \"I have an XYZ that I'm looking to sell…\" If the primary topic of the list is \"ABC\" and if the popping in happens frequently enough, you may want to define a policy e.g. my non-profit organization DC Python has a policy for job postings : \"DC Python helps Python programmers get jobs. We allow job postings on our meetup.dcpython.org mailing list provided the following criteria are met: You are posting for a Python job in Washington, DC or the surrounding metro area — please don't try to recruit PHP or Ruby or .NET developers here, and please don't try to recruit for other cities. You will put [JOB] in the subject line of the email and include a description of the job (including duties and location) in the body of the email. You are an active member of DC Python or you are willing to contribute financially either through a sponsorship or by providing food/drink at one of our meetings.\" That way whenever someone posts to the list or emails me personally about job postings, I can point them to the link: http://dcpython.org/#job-postings Pointing them at netiquette may help too, but that would require them to read through the archives to discover things like \"Wow, that recruiter got the smackdown when they identified themselves as a recruiter.\" So, a policy of netiquette plus an additional set of rules can go along way toward making communication better for everyone involved.

Or, they do not understand how I use it. Worse, they think they understand it [1] . So much so, some choose to comment about it publicly. Remember gittip is the future ? Someone commented: \"Nobody likes a beggar.\" — fuckoff@dfgd.com Really? Well, I have to agree. I don't like seeing panhandlers on the street. But I'd never yell \"Nobody likes a beggar!\" at them. Why? Because: I don't care what they do. Does their presence sometimes annoy me? Sure, because I have to read the sign. And then I have to nod, like \"What's up\" and \"Nah, sorry\" at the same time (an acquired skill). But that is not what bothers me the most about my friend @dfgd.com's comment. What bothers me the most is: I don't claim to know or understand why people do what they do. And short of a loitering law being broken somewhere, I think they have every right to do it (as long as they are not harming me or others). I'd even like to see a pandhandler use Square to accept payments. It sounds ridiculous, but I'd actually pay a panhandler that was accepting credit cards (I have no idea why this amuses me, but it does; of course, you may think twice about what is happening when they swipe but could a panhandler really figure out how to… I digress, back to the story.) Anyway, pro tip: the people who use gittip are not begging . Some (most?) never ask for a dime. I choose to promote my gittip link and I am now going to tell you why, so if anyone ever asks? Or condescends? Here it is: I like the project I like what Chad Whitacre is doing. I think it's a cool idea. I want to do everything I can to help him promote his service. I also like that people I know and like are being gittip'ed. It gives me a warm fuzzy inside. Hell, the entire \"top 10\" gives me a warm fuzzy. I like money I have a funny story I like tell to… well, to you, now: I've done AdSense in the past. For YEARS. One time one of my blog entries got about 40+ upvotes on Hacker News and my revenue went up as quickly as it ever had. This, after years of adsensing, tipped the scales to… YUP, you guessed it! $100. I got my check, and a copy of it is sitting nearby ready for framing. Was that the hardest $100 I ever made? Probably. But it felt damn good to make it. Similarly, with $2 per week in support, I stand to make another $100 much quicker than I ever did with AdSense. This, my friends, is progress. It may not seem like much to random people on the internet. In fact, it may even be laughable, disgusting, or any number of things to other people. But guess what: it's none of their business. Money is not my boss Some people go APE SHIT and get REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE in certain situations involving money. I am not one of them. Are you concerned that I'm not volunteering enough and getting paid too much? Don't be. I assure you, I can figure it out. If you have any questions, just ask me: aclark@aclark.net . Are you concerned that because I get paid, someone else may get the wrong impression about volunteering and why do some people get paid and some don't and don't you worry this may give the wrong…? No. I trust that if someone wants to volunteer, that's exactly what they are going to do. I have vision I picture any number of scenarios with gittip. Here are some: Do you like that I've spent years pouring my heart and soul into the Plone software and community, and perhaps, made your life better in some small way? Gittip me. Did you notice I forked the Python Imaging Library so that thousands of people could have a working PIL release? Gittip me. Did you also notice the new zc.buildout release that's much faster than the old release? Gittip me. (And a few others too, most especially: iElectric and zenwryly… you could also gittip Jim Fulton too, I guess :-)). Do you want me to handle your Python package releases on a regular basis for you, but you don't want to sign a contract with my consulting business or use pythonpackages.com? Gittip me. Do you want me to handle some other task on a regular basis, but you don't want to sign a contract with my consulting business? Gittip me. Are you aware of all those things and don't want to gittip me? That's fine too. I'm not entirely sure I'm making myself clear, but I will leave you with this: I will always donate my time freely to good causes, especially those near and dear to my heart. My non-profit organization DC Python has been working with the PyLadies to teach \"Introduction to Python Classes\" in DC. And I'm so grateful, because I want to grow the organization (as big as Mozilla?) and I need all the help I can get. But, I need to make a living too. And this is precisely where, as the old saying goes: \"the rubber meets the road\". I (like so many others before me and along with me in the Plone, Python, and Mozilla communities) have become an entrepreneur. In addition to thinking about \"what consulting projects am I going to work to pay my bills\", I like thinking about \"what services can I build to pay my bills\". And I'm so lucky I get the chance to do it.

As some of you can probably relate to, I've had my fair share of disagreements with the Plone Foundation Board over the years. The good news is, for the most part, it (just like the community) is staffed with very reasonable people who if you push them on an issue, will acknowledge that there are always competing viewpoints to any issue you can think of. The Fallacy Of False Cause I don't like what you have to say, therefore you must be quiet. Not necessarily. You may choose not to listen. As long as you are polite, respectful, and on topic: you can have a civil discussion with almost any human individual or group in today's world. The challenge is in sticking to those criteria . Conversations often become heated and stray outside of respectful lines, because we are human. Issues From the famous (?) pricing scrap of 2010 (i wanted a more expensive server with VM capability, they didn't) to various financially sensitive issues: i.e. I occasionally want to be financially compensated as a \"volunteer\". And while the Board does compensate volunteers in many ways, they frequently don't agree with the ways I've suggested. And who could forget Plone Conference 2008 ? This was the first year that the Foundation received a percentage of the ticket sales. Now if I recall correctly there were certainly some heated debates, but none were too taxing or unreasonable (unless you count the ones we collectively had with The Ronald Reagan Building ;-)). Success Plone's success [1] is my success and vice versa. I do a lot of different things in life, so I'm not going to say that Plone must succeed for me to succeed. But I must succeed, and if I can help Plone succeed too, I'm going to do everything within my power to make it happen. Let me be clear: Plone does not need me to be successful. But if you've seen the \"Plone: I wish I could quit you.\" T-Shirt by Tarek Ziadé (shown above), you may know why I keep struggling to make Plone as good as it can be, albeit by my excessively high and overly strict (but not unrealistic) standards; which some, I am sure, do not like. Conclusion I hope, after reading this, you may have some better idea of who I am and why I do what I do. I've made a commitment in my life to open source software, helping people, and being the best human I can be. I hope you will join me in my quest. If not, at the very least I hope you will respect my right to undertake it. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me to express them. Either in the comments below, or here: aclark@aclark.net . Here's to you, Plone. And to the next 10 years of success.

The more complex, the better. I have no formal training in debate , but I wish I did. It may have better prepared me to face different personality types with varying degree of communication skill. You don't have to watch the 2012 U.S. Presidential Debates to know that people will say things that are BATSHIT CRAZY to make their point. I've done it myself. That's why we need rules to formalize our discussions, because it's hard to stay on point. Fallacy In the course of debate, you may encounter a fallacy or \"faulty reasoning\". Discussion of fallacy is my favorite part of debate. So without further ado, my top 3 \"favorite\" [1] logical fallacies; of all those I've encountered since I begun to debate in electronic form in the mid-1990s. Disclaimer: I have been on both sides of all three, I'm human. My goal in writing this blog entry is to facilitate better conversations within the communities I care about: Mozilla, Python, and Plone. 1. \"You will regret your comments!\" This may be true, but it's probably not the point. And it's probably better to stay on topic then it is to stray into personal attacks, or what you may feel is \"helping\" [2] the other person. 2. \"You are out of line!\" This may be true too, but it may take both sides to acknowledge the lines. When discussing a point, even though it's tempting to cry foul, it's probably better to stay on point. Sometimes you need a break, in which case it's OK to say \"let's take a break and pick this up again later\" [3] 3. \"You are wrong!\" Perhaps. But it is likely that you may never agree with your debate counterparts. It's much better to focus on the core issues, and how you can compromise, then it is to focus attention on what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" (and who is right and wrong) [4] . Final Thoughts It feels great to get those out. If anyone reading this has formal training in debate, I would love to hear your comments. Either below, or: aclark@aclark.net . Like this blog entry? Consider supporting me on gittip . [1] I say \"favorite\" because these fallacies have crystallized in my brain over the years to the point where I feel I can categorize and discuss them. [2] I say \"helping\" because it's probably hurting the intended recipient (whether it's true or not). Sorry, it's not up to you to decide whether or not someone else will regret their comments. [3] I am married. And there is no better place in the world, than within the institution of marriage, to learn how to debate. :-) [4] There may be no tangible right or wrong, just preference. Discuss your preferences, then what you need from the other side to be happy. Then ask the other side to do the same.","tags":"Blog","title":"Top 3 \"favorite\" logical fallacies"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2012/10/15/hello-django/","text":"Test post This is a test post to create a Django tag feed.

Given the choice between an afternoon in the sun and upgrading Plone… OK I'd probably pick the sun, but it'd be close. Always upgrading? I would love to see the trend of continuous integration make its way all the way to deployment, so that one day our Plone sites are getting new code as soon as it's released. Until then, it's nice to know that Plone's upgrade procedure is fairly predictable and stable, if not entirely straightforward [1] . How do I upgrade? Unfortunately we still get asked this question in IRC. The TLDR (short) explanation is as follows. Got an old Plone? Here's what you should do: Don't touch it! Leave it alone. It's probably doing something important. Install the latest Plone somewhere that is not the location of your current site. Maybe not even on the same machine. Copy the production Data.fs file (usually in var/ somewhere) and any blobs you may have (Plone 4 or greater) to the new installation. Restart Plone in the foreground (bin/instance fg). If it starts, great! If it doesn't, look for missing add-ons and add their newest-Plone counterparts (this is usually where all the real work happens). Can't find the latest version? Try contacting the author. Stuck? Try Plone support ( http://plone.org/support ) or hire a consultant (e.g. http://aclark.net ). Otherwise, continue. Once your add-ons are in place, start the site in the foreground and give the ZMI a poke (stay out of Plone). Look for broken objects. If you find some, repeat the previous step. Otherwise, continue. Once the ZMI looks good, trigger the migration with the Dry Run checkbox selected. See what you get. If it completes, do it for real. If it doesn't, open a ticket on http://dev.plone.org so we can track the kinds of issues that folks are encountering in the wild. At this point if you are stuck, try to get help from the support forums ( http://plone.org/support ) or hire a consultant (e.g. http://aclark.net ). Otherwise, you are almost done! Run the upgrade for real i.e. with the Dry Run checkbox unselected. When it finishes (it could take a while depending on the size of your site) check Plone. If everything looks OK, rejoice! If not, don't worry. Check: Site Setup -> ZMI -> portal_skins -> custom . If there is anything inside the custom folder, rename the custom folder to custom_X_X where X_X equals the previous Plone version e.g. custom_3_3 . Or, rename it to whatever you like. Or delete it if you don't care about any in-database customizations that have been made. You probably should care, but maybe you don't. Now check Plone again. If everything looks OK, you are done! If not… well you really should be done by now. So if not, please email me: aclark@aclark.net and I will try to help. That's still a lot to swallow for a summary. The key point is this: test the upgrade away from the production site. Don't put yourself in an unpleasant situation you can easily avoid . Once everything works as expected, make a copy of your Data.fs and perform the upgrade on the production site (by editing the buildout.cfg if you know how, or just make the new Plone installation the production site. Need help? Please feel free to email me: aclark@aclark.net to discuss professional assistance.) How did I upgrade? Anyway, the point of this blog entry is to cover the recent upgrade of http://aclark.net to Plone 4.3a1, and the bliss that ensued. Plone 4.3 has lots of goodness in it, most notably the new theme editor from Martin Aspeli. Whilst I haven't fully explored its possibilites, I definitely liked seeing it in place; it's an impressive piece of work and I suspect will be very useful to lots of folks. So here is a brief summary of my upgrade steps, which took about 2-3 days. Create a new empty repo I started with a public repo in my personal GitHub account, then forked it to my organization for showcasing: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/new_style Add the buildout Yes, we are still married to Buildout for even the simplest deployments :-/. So in order to make this easy for myself and others, I maintain buildouts for every version of Plone under the http://pythonpackages.com umbrella. I typically start like this from within the checked out repo: $ virtualenv . $ bin/pip install zc.buildout $ bin/buildout init I then extend the desired base configuration ( 4.3.x-dev in this case) and add additional customizations as needed. [buildout] extends = http://pythonpackages.com/buildout/plone/4.3.x-dev [plone] eggs + = z3c.jbot ZODB3 scripts = ZODB3 resources = ${buildout:directory}/resources zcml-additional = # XXX Can this be done with p.r.zope2instance yet? <configure xmlns:browser = \"http://namespaces.zope.org/browser\" > <include package=\"z3c.jbot\" file=\"meta.zcml\" /> <browser:jbot directory=\"${buildout:directory}/templates\" /> </configure> [versions] Cheetah = 2.2.1 Pillow = 1.7.7 Products.DocFinderTab = 1.0.5 Products.FSDump = 0.9.5 collective.recipe.supervisor = 0.17 gdata = 2.0.17 meld3 = 0.6.9 plone.app.debugtoolbar = 1.0a2 supervisor = 3.0b1 z3c.jbot = 0.7.1 zope2-bootstrap = 0.0.7 Develop the Diazo theme With Diazo, Python packaging is optional. And the resources parameter available from plone.recipe.zope2instance makes it easy to start theming without a Python package. I started with a bootstrap template: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang= \"en\" > <head> <meta charset= \"utf-8\" > <title> Bootstrap, from Twitter </title> <meta name= \"viewport\" content= \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" > <meta name= \"description\" content= \"\" > <meta name= \"author\" content= \"\" > <!-- Le styles --> <link href= \"/++theme++static/css/bootstrap.css\" rel= \"stylesheet\" > <link href= \"/++theme++static/css/new_style.css\" rel= \"stylesheet\" > <link href= 'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald' rel= 'stylesheet' type= 'text/css' > <style type= \"text/css\" > body { padding-top : 60px ; padding-bottom : 40px ; } </style> <!-- Le HTML5 shim, for IE6-8 support of HTML5 elements --> <!--[if lt IE 9]> <script src=\"http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js\"></script> <![endif]--> <!-- Le fav and touch icons --> <link rel= \"shortcut icon\" href= \"/++theme++static/img/favicon.ico\" > <link rel= \"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes= \"144x144\" href= \"/++theme++static/ico/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png\" > <link rel= \"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes= \"114x114\" href= \"/++theme++static/ico/apple-touch-icon-114-precomposed.png\" > <link rel= \"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes= \"72x72\" href= \"/++theme++static/ico/apple-touch-icon-72-precomposed.png\" > <link rel= \"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href= \"/++theme++static/ico/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png\" > <script type= \"text/javascript\" > var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq . push ([ '_setAccount' , 'UA-35125830-1' ]); _gaq . push ([ '_trackPageview' ]); ( function () { var ga = document . createElement ( 'script' ); ga . type = 'text/javascript' ; ga . async = true ; ga . src = ( 'https:' == document . location . protocol ?

Add content I then cut/pasted all my content from the old site to the new site. This is a lot of work, but I like mimicking the experience of someone non-tech-savvy using Plone for the first time. What's left? I am very happy with this upgrade, but of course it's not perfect. Use Sunburst theme for content editing If you are Diazo-savvy, you may notice I completely ignore styling the content editing interface. Instead I rely on the unthemed [2] site for content editing. Use Diazo theme for public facing view Of course, visitors to http://aclark.net see the Diazo theme. I'm hoping that the Plone team can unify the content editing experience again in Plone 5, possibly via simplifying the \"old style\" templates such that it's easier to map them to custom Diazo themes. Hightlights Lastly, I'll cover some of the remaining highlights. It works! Plone 4.3a1 is remarkably stable. The TinyMCE UI is a bit rough, and the sitemap is broken [3] , but it works. The All content view is awesome Contributed by Laurence Rowe for Plone 4, I use the All content view in two places: http://aclark.net/services http://aclark.net/team I love the ability to easily aggregate the contents of pages within a folder. My deployment is awesome I'm really happy with the following trick I used this time around: Content is stored in Data.fs (of course) which I've checked into a private repo on bitbucket, and save nightly with an automated commit and push. I'm able to present the site buildout and theme to the public but keep the Data.fs private via git submodules. Prior to this, the entire site was stored in a private repo on bitbucket. And finally: If you load the site, you'll notice the images (configured as static resources) are a bit laggy. I'm a big fan of of CloudFlare and current user via pythonpackages.com, so I'll probably be configuring aclark.net to use it soon too. Once that is done, the site should be lightning fast instead of just really fast. Like this article and/or my open source work in general? Please consider supporting me on gittip . [1] Some ideas for improving upgrades: 1.) optionally rename portal_skins/custom during the upgrade process. 2.) Include suggestions in the form copy to stage the upgrade away from the current production site. 3.) Report on availability of add-ons compatible with latest version of Plone. [2] Unthemed meaning un-diazo-themed. The content UI is themed with the Sunburst theme \"the old way\".

But in terms of possible-financial-success i.e. the potential of converting some of those sign ups in to actual customers I'd feel better if we were at 2,000 or higher. What happened? As of the launch of the beta site 3 months ago, there are some actually-useful features available: The ability to release a package from GitHub to PyPI without a terminal (i.e. in the web browser). The ability to release a package with git push (by adding the service: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/pythonpackages.rb ) The ability to \"manage packages\" (see image below) The ability to \"manage organizations\" (see image below) The ability to create packages through the web (i.e. from the web browser to GitHub, whereas normally you'd run PasteScript in your Terminal). And a few more logistical features that are cool: The ability to pay with a credit card (via Stripe) The ability to oauth against PyPI: Still, we have only scratched the surface of what could potentially be provided to the Python community. Future plans include: The ability to easily build Windows installers for your Python software. Support for other services e.g. bitbucket. Support git branches i.e. for releasing from a branch. In summary, this is a great start to building \"github style\" automation for Python packaging but there is much more work to be done. What now? I am in the process of winding down the 3 month \"beta 1\" period. The \"beta 2\" period (from now until the end of the year) will likely include: Adding MailChimp integration to make it easier to email subscribers. Turn off SSL to save $20/month. Write tests and open source the application. What can you do to help? If you believe in the ideas behind pythonpackages.com (primarily: eliminating the need to think about packaging at all; e.g. through task automation, and process improvement behind the scenes; i.e. supporting new technology like distutils2/packaging, wheel, et al.; in order to present a seemless packaging story to developer-consumers.) then the best thing you can do is to purchase a paid plan: http://pythonpackages.com/plans The second best thing you can do is support me on gittip: https://gittip.com/aclark4life These funds will go towards covering hosting costs until such time as the service can pay for itself. I am also asking folks who appreciate my open source work in general to consider a gittip donation. If you cannot help financially, you can still use the free plan to release packages! Please try it out and give feedback . (The paid plans get you access to more package slots, so you don't have to swap out the free slot, and organizations, so you can release packages from organization repos). Thanks for considering!","tags":"Blog","title":"pythonpackages-com one year later"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2012/09/24/diazo-themes-revisited/","text":"With Diazo theming on the rise (going in to 4.3 core) I'd like to take a look at the Diazo theming ecosystem again. For that matter, since I know that some folks will never commit to Diazo, I'd like to take a look at the entire Plone theming ecosystem. What are themes? Themes control the way the site looks. For the scope of this post, at least, I don't care about \"views\", \"viewlets\", \"portlets\", \"tiles\", etc. In fact, I'm not sure I ever want to mix \"templating\" (for lack of a better word) with theming. There is a bit of discussion going on right now amongst the core developers regarding how to make it easier for themers to associate their template code with application code. And while I fully support this discussion, at present the bottom line is: \"Old style\" [1] theming is still a valid way to control the look and feel of a Plone system. \"New style\" (Diazo) theming is a great way to isolote the complexity of the stack and get HTML/CSS/JavaScript folks going quickly (especially in 4.3a1 with the new theme editor!) Where are themes? In short: all over the place. Why is that? Because we are in the middle of several fluctuating \"best practice\" approaches that have fluctuated over the past half decade or so: Plone developers should release their Plone add-ons [2] to PyPI! Plone developers should release their Plone add-ons to plone.org (in addition to PyPI)! Plone developers should release their Diazo themes as zip archives (i.e. no Python package)! Hence, the need for this post to clarify the status quo. What should I do? Everyone should form their own opinion based on the information in this post and act accordingly or however they see fit. If we can all agree on an approach, great! If not, here's what I'm doing. What am I doing? While I have a large interest in seeing plone.org work well (and am also in the middle of helping to cat herd a plone.com marketing site effort), I have given up on plone.org as a reliable, consistent source for add-ons (in favor of PyPI). This abandonment is perhaps only temporary, but in any event for now: if it's on PyPI, it's good enough for me. Also to close the loop on Diazo zip themes, while I fully support this approach I don't use it myself much. What is the point? All of this brings me to the actual point of this post which is to take a quick look at the Plone themeing landscape in order to spur more Diazo theme development (or old style theming, if that is your thing). Quickly, using pip to search PyPI by package namespace I see: 88 plonetheme themes : plonetheme.Bangalore - An installable theme for Plone 3 plonetheme.GreenEarthTheme3_0 - An installable theme for Plone 3 plonetheme.ReOrg -

If we had the man power, all of these themes could be made to work with the latest Plone and work with either old style or new style technology. So if we can't do that (which is a hugely ambitious goal) let's at least try to come close! Do you like this post, and/or appreciate my open source work? Help build the commons by gittiping me: https://www.gittip.com/aclark4life/ . [1] It's getting harder to define what \"old style\" theming is. For this blog entry, old style theming is some form of customizing the main_template in Plone (I'm ignoring the fact that macros called by main_template are customizable, for now). If we could (consistently, in a core supported way) get newer ways to do that (e.g. browser views instead of CMF skin layers) then \"old style\" would become \"newer style\". It wouldn't become \"new style\" because Diazo technology is \"newer\" than browser view technology. Get it? I think my point is this: in addition to seeing Diazo help with isolating the complexity of the stack, I'd like to see the underlying technology modernized. Give me something that looks and feels like \"old style\" theming (i.e. putting templates in CMF skin layers) but that is built on modern technology (i.e. the ZCA).

If not, you should know: it has a lot of people (including me) excited about the potential to make a living doing what they love. From the Gittip blog [1] : Gittip is a system for funding people who build free culture. The core is small weekly gifts. The idea is that if 1,000 people give $1 a week to a great programmer, musician, scientist, teacher, etc., then that frees them up to pursue their vision even further for making the world better. I love this idea! In particular, because it speaks to me more than other similar offerings: Chipin Flattr Kickstarter Paypal Why? If for no other reason, because it comes from a member of the Python community: Chad Whitacre of http://aspen.io fame. And the Python community has become near and dear to me, second only to my-one-true-open-source-love: Plone. So I want to see open source developers, particularly Python developers, succeed. And succeed they will, with gittip. Some particularly impressive results so far: Chad Whitacre, the founder, is making almost $160 per week: https://www.gittip.com/whit537/ David Glick, a newly independent Plone developer, is making over $100 per week: https://www.gittip.com/davisagli/ Read The Docs, everyone's favorite documentation hosting site, is making almost $100 per week: https://www.gittip.com/readthedocs/ Whilst no one is making a living off of gittip yet, with enough support and momentum it's only a matter of time before they do. Toward that end, I have written a blog entry for the gittip blog describing among other things: how I'd like to make a living with gittip. Here is an excerpt: Chad's vision for Gittip really speaks to me. All over the world there are thousands of open source developers writing code, managing projects, and moving the world of open source technology forward. This helps millions of individuals, companies and the entire world with a variety of its endeavours. What if those folks could easily show their appreciation to individuals known to make open source happen? What if these volunteer developers didn't need to go get \"day jobs\" to make a living because the world has taken care of them? What if companies didn't need to hire employees in the traditional sense because their needs have already been met by open source? There is a lot to think about and strive for here, and I'm really excited to help Chad with his mission. On a daily basis I'm involved with, and influential to the following open source projects: Plone (Python-based CMS), Pillow (Python Imaging Library fork), Buildout (Python-based build system), and more. I hope Gittip can help me help you, the open source community and the world. You can read the rest of the article here: http://blog.gittip.com/post/31960853095/back-the-stack-pythonpackages-com And if you'd like to help me, I'm attempting to cover the hosting costs for my startup business: pythonpackages.com , so I can keep developing it for another year. I truly believe in my vision of a \"hosted packaging service\", and I really want to help the Python community fix its packaging story in any way that I can. If in no other way, than by making it so you don't have to think about Python packaging at all (i.e. I'll worry about the various complexities, so you don't have to).

A couple years ago, I started using Wordpress in order to learn its feature set. I enjoyed my time with it, but after moving to wordpress.com for \"trouble free\" hosting, I found I couldn't control my category feeds the way I wanted; the honeymoon was over. This was a giant let down, because I was hoping to avoid putting any time in to my blogging infrastructure. For weeks I did nothing. I poked at various options: Pelican, Plone, Tumblr, others. Eventually, I found my way back to Pelican and now I'm happy again. Pelican is a static blog generator, as you may have heard. So one big advantage is: You can host it for free, or close to free on any number of free or cheap static website hosting services! (I'm using GitHub Pages) Other advantages It does feeds right (I need 3 \"full body\" feeds for: Mozilla, Plone, Python) [1] . It's fun to configure (edit pelicanconf.py or publishconf.py). The \"cool kids\" use it: e.g. Tarek Ziadé, Kenneth Reitz, Daniel Greenfeld, many others. It grows with you: this is huge. You can start using it and feel comfortable right away, but there is always more to learn. This is how all software should be. Unfortunately, it's tough to get it right (I think this is formally called UX). Some disadvantages Don't like typing in the terminal? Pelican is not for you. No \"nested\" entries e.g. 2012/09/21/entry.html. I don't know if there is a formal name for this feature, but I miss it (if for no other reason than \"cool URLS never change\" i.e. I've broken links with this move.) The pelican-import has some bugs, so I'm doing a lot of manual cleanup (I don't mind this though.) Tags are categories and categories are tags (or something). I had to convert all my categories to tags, and then turn on tag feeds and turn off category feeds. Category feeds are on by default and tag feeds are off by default. Also ATOM is on and RSS is off, if that is of interest to you. (Since this is really just configuration change and not a disadvantage per sé, it probably belongs more in the next section where I discuss my setup.) If you are curious about my setup, here are the details. Setup Getting started with Pelican was easy, basically: $ virtualenv . $ bin/pip install pelican BeautifulSoup Markdown $ bin/pelican-quickstart At this point, after I answer the quickstart questions I: $ source bin/activate $ make html Now the content is ready to host (which for me just involves a git push). Tweaks A few things were tricky. I wanted to host my articles at the top level of the repo for serving on GitHub Pages, so I modified the Makefile to make it so [2] . Categories control what links are available in the header, so I disabled them all but one called \"Blog\". Not ideal, but it works. The \"social\" links, and my disqus and analytics API keys were all a pleasure to configure. Workflow Now I write articles in restructured text in the content/ directory and publish them like so: $ make publish; git commit -a -m \"Publish\"; git push All the details are here if you'd like to take a look: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclarknet.github.com/commits/master Comments from more knowledgable Pelican users welcome. Like this article? Tip me on Gittip! [1] This is actually my first \"test\" post with Pelican so I will get a chance to see how the feeds perform. But they looked good in testing. [2] I think I broke \"make html\", actually. Primarily I just needed to make it not \"clean\" the entire repo.","tags":"Blog","title":"Yes, this blog is now powered by Pelican"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2012/08/13/bootstrapping-a-buildout-1-6-release/","text":"A lot of work has been done on Buildout lately, most notably: Jim Fulton is working on Buildout 2 .

PythonPackages GitHub Service There is a new GitHub Service available for pythonpackages.com that allows you to release Python packages from GitHub to the Python Package Index, simply by pushing a commit message that begins with \"Release\" e.g.: $ git commit -a -m \"Release 1.0\"; git push (The release creates a tag with the appropriate version number, extracted from setup.py) To use the service, please follow the instructions below. Instructions Sign up for the pythonpackages.com beta: http://pythonpackages.com/signup . Follow the Introduction instructions. On the Python Package Index, authorize pythonpackages.com to act on your behalf, as explained here: http://blog.aclark.net/pythonpackagescom-using-pypi039s-oauth1-support-to-register-and-upload-packages.html ( pythonpackages.com -> Dashboard -> Manage accounts -> PyPI -> Authorize ). On GitHub, configure the PythonPackages service to be Active on any repository that contains a Python package you want to release ( Repo -> Admin -> Service Hooks -> PythonPackages -> [*] Active ). Now you can git push to release! If you have any trouble, please open a ticket .

And using his sample code I was able to take advantage of it on pythonpackages.com. The result is a fairly elegant approach to releasing packages sans dirty hacks (I had been asking users for their username and password, then storing them in an encrypted session cookies so I could send them to PyPI.) Here's how it works now. Sign In With GitHub GitHub provides an easy way to let folks sign in to pythonpackages.com with their APIv3. I was able to code the OAuth dance using only the requests library (HT Kenneth Reitz). This was working as of late 2011. Select a package Once you are signed in, you can select a package. Selected packages can perform various actions, one of which is Tag and Release . As soon as you select Tag and Release, you are required to authenticate with PyPI. [STRIKEOUT:Enter your PyPI credentials] In order to get the beta out the door, a dirty hack was added to allow users to enter their PyPI credentials. Credentials were saved in an encrypted session cookie, then written out to .pypirc before calling `python setup.py upload`. Really terrible. This was shipped in early July 2012 and is thankfully no longer necessary (though it is still necessary to push the initial commit to GitHub. ) Authorize pythonpackages.com Now authorization can happen elegantly via OAuth1. First, sign in to PyPI. Then authorize pythonpackages.com to act on your behalf. Lastly, profit (register and upload your package). Register and upload your package At this point you are free to tag and release. I am really excited about this. I began fantasizing about it almost a year ago and after several false starts (pypissh, openid, avoidance) it is now a reality.

So here's a proof of concept for building Windows installers quickly and easily \"in the cloud\" (i.e. without a Windows machine local). This article is mostly about the back end, as the front end is already documented . TL;DR: We're moving from proof-of-concept phase to useful-service phase. If you find the demo interesting and want to help build something great, please consider purchasing one of our current plans . Step 1: To The Clouds For the purpose of the demo, I booted up a Windows server on Rackspace Cloud and started installing things. On the short list of things to install was: Python 2.7 from python.org. GitHub for Windows from github.com (mainly for git.) pythonpackages.com from bitbucket.org (free private repos!) Microsoft compiler (free version, make sure to use the same one used to compile Python.) Redis for Windows (Hell froze over, you can find this in Microsoft's GitHub account: https://github.com/MSOpenTech/Redis .) Vim.exe (which I copy to vi.exe because I hate typing vim.) Once I had all these things in place, I was able to: Install pythonpackages.com (pip install -r requirements.txt.) Compile and run Redis (Several projects bundled together in Visual Studio is apparently called a \"solution\", how quaint!) Start the site. Start testing. Step 2: Fix all the bugs This step involved a lot of cursing: Backslashes. Lack of vi key bindings. Other Windows-isms. But I also praised my CoRD Remote Desktop Client because it worked awesome. Anyway, the bugs/issues I fixed (and didn't fix) were roughly: Create new application on GitHub and configured keys accordingly. Switch Stripe keys to testing. Fix Python paths and other trivial changes, so the application can run `python setup.py bdist_wininst`. JavaScript is completely broken for some reason I've yet to determine (haven't looked yet, but guessing Windows path related). Step 3: Profit! I have to admit: I was giddy when it started working, and I was able to create a Windows Installer for Pillow (Python Imaging Library fork). I was even happier when I ran the installer and it worked. That's it. Next I hope to get some customers so I can keep the Windows box running, and make it available to the public. Big Picture In case you are interested, the roadmap for beta Q3 is here . I will also mention that I recently used Dia (<3) to create this info-graphic, in hopes of better communicating what I'm trying to build.

Originally, I thought if the fork went nowhere, at least the Plone community could maintain it for its own needs. However since then, a number of folks outside the Plone community have taken an interest, so I've decided to move the repository from the Plone collective to a new organization called python-imaging . With this change, I hope to gather folks to help develop a Python 3-compat release before PyCon 2013. (There are various PIL forks with Python 3-compat already in existence, as well as the official PIL 1.2-dev tarball available from bitbucket, which has some Python 3-compat if I understand correctly.)

Knights Templar) I think we have a situation that could use the help of the Plone and Python communities at large. It goes something like this: About 6 years ago, Daniel Nouri started the ZopeSkel project to provide a Zope project template to PasteScript Sometime between then and now, the Plone community latched on to the ZopeSkel project to include templates for its projects. About 3 years ago, as part of the ZopeSkel project, some folks at the BBQ sprint built a more user friendly UI on top of PasteScript. And some refactoring of the project was planned or occurred, during which time the entire project was renamed to \"Templer\". At present, if you install the latest ZopeSkel (3.0b3) you get: $ bin/paster create --list-templates Available templates: archetype: A Plone project that uses Archetypes content types basic_buildout: A basic buildout skeleton basic_namespace: A basic Python project with a namespace package basic_package: A basic setuptools-enabled package nested_namespace: A basic Python project with a nested namespace (2 dots in name) paste_deploy: A web application deployed through paste.deploy plone_basic: A package for Plone add-ons plone_nested: A package for Plone add-ons with a nested namespace recipe: A recipe project for zc.buildout zope2_basic: A Zope project zope2_nested: A nested-namespace Zope package Looks nice, but some templates are missing. If you install the previous stable version (2.21.2), you get this: $ bin/paster create --list-templates Available templates: archetype: A Plone project that uses Archetypes content types basic_namespace: A basic Python project with a namespace package basic_package: A basic setuptools-enabled package basic_zope: A Zope project kss_plugin: A project for a KSS plugin nested_namespace: A basic Python project with a nested namespace (2 dots in name) paste_deploy: A web application deployed through paste.deploy plone: A project for Plone add-ons plone2.5_buildout: A buildout for Plone 2.5 projects plone2.5_theme: A theme for Plone 2.5 plone2_theme: A theme for Plone 2.1 plone3_buildout: A buildout for Plone 3 installation plone3_portlet: A Plone 3 portlet plone3_theme: A theme for Plone 3 plone4_buildout: A buildout for Plone 4 developer installation plone_app: A project for Plone add-ons with a nested namespace (2 dots in name) plone_hosting: Plone hosting: buildout with ZEO and Plone versions below 3.2 plone_pas: A project for a Plone PAS plugin recipe: A recipe project for zc.buildout silva_buildout: A buildout for Silva projects Looks a lot better. Additionally, with the previous release (2.21.2) you can install zopeskel.dexterity, and \"dexterity\" will show up in the list of available templates (but not so with 3.0b3). So what's left to finish the move from ZopeSkel to Templer? I'm told by Chris Ewing (the current project lead) that it's mostly a matter of missing imports in various Python packages that provide templates to PasteScript. Let's. Finish. This. This frustrates me because Paster is a nice system (that provides pluggable commands, and code gen from templates). And ZopeSkel was a nice system (that provided additional templates and a friendly UI). And Templer will be a great system, but it's not there yet. So we need to help Chris et. al. get it there ASAP. In addition to the code refactoring, they have produced some nice documentation available on readthedocs.org .

How many of us cringe whenever we see these words? Lately I've been spending a lot of time developing pythonpackages.com , (now running on heroku!) during which time I see a lot of these kinds of packages being released. I kid about the killing part, but seriously: this is a problem . Fortunately for us, our PyPI overloads see fit to occasionally remove these packages, and for this I am grateful. I mean it makes me dance-around-the-room happy! Ahem. But are they really all gone? Close enough. A quick crate.io search now shows only 2 packages instead of 4 pages of results. Hallelujah! But is this the best we can do? I know that some well-meaning person wrote a book containing the example that is leading some poor, misguided souls to spam PyPI (if only the author listed the test site instead: http://testpypi.python.org/pypi ). And I have to assume that this was just some terrible mistake. But do we all have to live with this mistake? I'm asking because I honestly don't know the answer. I remember when I started pythonpackages.com, the Deliverance documentation was being updated something like every 5 minutes (kidding again, but it was frequent enough to be annoying). After grousing about it in public, it stopped happening!

TL;DR: I <3 the Beastie Boys and will miss Adam Yauch; and I suspect many others in the tech world do, and will, too Where I came from For as long as I can remember, I've been trying to emulate my heroes. It started with pop music in the 80s and artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and of course the Beastie Boys. While I was obsessed with Michael Jackson back then, I don't recall trying too hard to emulate the Beastie Boys… until the 90s. In the early 90s, I was just out of high school (where I discovered Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Beatles, Stones etc), was working full time at Chili's, and had no serious plans for college. I was really into music, but didn't have the social skills required to participate in any meaningful activities, like playing in a band. But I loved music. I listened to Nirvana, Beastie Boys, and any number of other pop, rock and rap acts of the 90s. I went to rock shows at the 8x10 in Baltimore and 9:30 club in DC. I went to festivals like the HFSistival and Lollapalooza. Throughout the decade, I formulated my thoughts on how I would, one day, start a band. To say the Beastie Boys were inspirational to me during this time period would be a colossal understatement (remember the first time you saw the \"So Watcha Want?\" video?) While I wholly identified with the angst-ridden music of Nirvana, I also equally identified with the good natured spirit of, and dope-ass-jams from, the Beastie Boys: three guys producing kick ass music with, among other instruments, a \"bullshit mic, made out of plastic\". Most importantly: they never took themselves too seriously. They made great music, but they were also just like you and me. They made you feel like you could do it, too. In the late 90s and early to mid 2000s, I finally got a chance to play music. I started a band, played some shows, recorded a few albums, and had a lot of fun. Most importantly: I proved to myself I could do it. The shows I put on with my band were awesome; they were true rock shows: those in which the audience responded positively, viscerally. There is no better feeling in the world than that type of self-expression. Who I am now Eventually the band imploded, and I found a new obsession: technology. I have always been obsessed with tech, but never focused on it exclusively until the mid to late 2000s. Now I have a new set of heroes to emulate, and many new things to prove to myself I can do. Maybe I'll even play music again one day, but if I don't, I know that I accomplished, on some level, what I set out to do. And that is a great feeling. Where we are all headed We are all headed forward, now, without Adam Yauch to inspire us anew. This sucks more than words can express; but it is, alas, a part of life. Without death to make life precious, there would be no joy in living. We all only have a short period of time in life to accomplish our goals, so it is important that we spend time trying to do so. (And if your goals include helping other people, bonus points from Adam.) I cannot thank Adam Yauch (MCA), Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock), and Mike D enough; for providing me with all the inspiration I needed, when I needed it, to live my life; it has made all the difference. I know that Ad-Rock and Mike D will continue to live their lives; and whether that includes performing as \"Beastie Boys\" or not, does not matter to me; I will still be watching, waiting to be inspired again. And to Adam Yauch who has rapped, joked, snowboarded, and philanthropized his way through all our lives: thank you for the inspiration; I use it every day, and I'll never forget it was you and your closest two brothers Ad-Rock and Mike D who gave it to me.","tags":"Blog","title":"Adam Yauch has passed"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2012/04/04/test-plone-tmp/","text":"Since Day 1 with Plone circa 2004, I've always taken pride in and greatly enjoyed refining my development environment.

You do not need to have any Python skills whatsoever to perform these tasks. New Plone themes are: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/images (Sound familiar? You don't need to know any Plone to understand this part.) A set of rules that map your HTML/CSS/JavaScript/images to Plone content. (This part is Diazo-specific; and while Diazo is not part of Plone, integration is provided by a Python package called plone.app.theming.) The Diazo rules can get complex, but it's very easy to get your first rule done and working and then off you go. You may find this new tutorial on pythonpackages.com .

It was fun answering in 2009 , so I thought I'd play again. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2011? Pyramid . In early 2011 I released vanity , which later became pythonpackages.com (more or less). I used building the site as an excuse to learn Pyramid, and it was well worth it. What new programming technique did you learn in 2011? I learned to not reinvent the wheel, and to collaborate with others on solving hard problems (which in and of itself is hard). Long story short, I took a little bit of heat within the Plone CMS community for creating a \"one off\" migration script: http://pythonpackages.com/info/parse2plone I've since learned my lesson and have been collaborating meaningfully with Dylan Jay on the more widely-supported mr.migrator and friends. What's the name of the open source project you contributed to the most in 2011? What did you do? I contributed to the Plone project quite a bit (as I have been doing for years now), but I also fell in love with Mozilla (and their mission) and began working on various things, including a virtual machine to help with the development of support.mozilla.com : https://github.com/aclark4life/kitsune-vagrant What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011? Hacker news . I have the start-up bug. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012? JavaScript, JavaScript, and JavaScript. I first heard the term 15 years ago and have been avoiding it ever since. Time to jump in. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2012?

(And please forgive the heavily meme-laden approach to describing these techniques :-).) Cache ALL the hosts Our ability to use Varnish in production is no secret by now, or at least it shouldn't be. What is often less clear is exactly how to use it. One way I like[1], is to run Varnish on your public IP port 80 and make Apache listen on your private IP port 80. Then proxy from Varnish to Apache and enjoy easy caching goodness on all your virtual hosts in Apache. Configuration This should require less than five minutes of down time to implement. First, configure the appropriate settings. (Well, first install Apache and Varnish if you haven't already: `aptitude install varnish apache2` on Ubuntu Linux[0].) Varnish To modify the listen IP address and port, we typically edit a file like /etc/default/varnish (in Ubuntu). However you do it, configure the equivalent of the following on your system: DAEMON_OPTS=\"-a 174.143.252.11:80 -T localhost:6082 -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl -s malloc,256m\" This environment variable is then passed to varnishd on the command line. Next, pass traffic to Apache like so (in /etc/varnish/default.vcl on Ubuntu): backend default { .host = \"127.0.0.1\"; .port = \"80\"; } Now on to Apache. *Please note that the syntax above is for Varnish 3.x and the syntax has (annoyingly) changed from 2.x to 3.x.* Apache The Apache part is a bit simpler. You just need to change the listen port (on Ubuntu this is done in /etc/apache2/ports.conf ), typically from something like: Listen *:80 to: Listen 127.0.0.1:80 Restart ALL the services Now restart both services. If all goes well you shouldn't notice any difference, except better performance, and when you make a website change and need to clear the cache[2]. For this, I rely on telnetting to the varnish port and issuing the `ban.url` command (formerly `url.purge` in 2.x): $ telnet localhost 6082 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost.

Here's why. For almost as long as I have been involved in the Plone project, I've been interested in Plone's role in the Python ecosystem. Today as I look across the current landscape, I'm proud to announce a new milestone the Plone community can take pride in. But the change didn't happen overnight, so first let's take a quick look back. PyPI support in PSC Circa 2008, Tarek Ziadé and others finished the PyPI integration branch of PloneSoftwareCenter started by Sidnei Da Silva 2 years before. This was a big step towards the \"Pythonification\" of Plone, mainly because Plone packages could now be published on plone.org in the same way Python packages are published to the Python Package Index: via \"python setup.py upload\". In fact if you are publishing Plone packages, it is recommended that you release to both PyPI and plone.org simultaneously. This ensures your package is visible to the most number of potential users. And you can use mkrelease to automate the process. Collective docs at RTD Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting in Python land, along came readthedocs.org (a Django Dash production, IIRC). And to join the fun in July 2011 , I moved Mikko Ohtamaa's awesome Plone Community Managed Developer Manual to the Github collective and configured the RTD service hook . This means that whenever anyone commits a change to the developer manual, within a few minutes a new Sphinx build gets published . It was so easy to set this up, I wish I had done it sooner. So you can that see over the years, we have been working ourselves into a frenzy of Python goodness! And last week, it got even better. Introducing: Plone packages! Thanks to the good folks at Cartwheel Web , makers of the fine Open Comparison service, Plone now has its very own grid comparison website ! ( Djangopackages.com was first, followed by pyramid.opencomparison.org .) This is a site where folks can add packages hosted elsewhere (e.g. svn, github, pypi), vote on them, and add grid comparisons to compare similarly-featured add-ons, frameworks, and other related software. Grids are the killer feature of this site, and personally I've been waiting to use them to answer questions like: Q: What's the best blogging add-on for Plone? A: http://plone.opencomparison.org/grids/g/weblogs/ The content is entirely user driven (TTW only) so please head over to plone.opencomparison.org , login with your github ID, and start adding packages! And while you are at it, please report any issues you find here: https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison/issues . Lastly, let's all tweet a big thanks to @pydanny and @audreyr for their hard work and generosity!","tags":"Blog","title":"Plone: First class Python citizen"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/10/14/pillow-one-year-later/","text":"For anyone unfamiliar with Pillow, it is the \"friendly PIL fork\": a fork of PIL that aims to remain a good citizen in the PIL community through its actions. Warm and fluffy history Pillow 1.0 was released on 2010-07-31, a little over a year later came Pillow 1.7.5 which features: Many packaging fixes (mostly to support dependency libraries) Windows binaries Over 13K downloads Pillow is used in Plone's UnifiedInstaller , and I know folks from the Django community are using it. Future creature comforts All in all, a mild success. So what's next? More of the same . To quote myself from a recent Stack Overflow answer : If PIL ever does exactly what Pillow does, then the fork will die. Until that happens, we have Pillow. Bottom line accommodations This may never happen of course, which is part of the reason for the fork. You can't force someone to maintain software for you. But in the open source world you can grab the bull by the horns (take the lead) and try to make things better. Even better: if your project and community are healthy and functioning properly, your success or failure will be determined by the folks in the community (as it should be). In this case, the Plone and Python communities have spoken clearly.","tags":"Blog","title":"Pillow: one year later"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/10/03/vagrant-puppet-and-mozilla-oh-my/","text":"Warning: This post is only loosely Python related and not at all Plone related, but I thought folks might enjoy hearing about Vagrant and Puppet because these tools may help you do your Plone and Python jobs better. For the past couple weeks I've been working on creating a virtual machine to bootstrap a kitsune environment. Kitsune is the Django site that powers support.mozilla.com. I've now reached what I call the 2nd milestone . Milestones The milestones are as follows: Get the VM running to the point where one can type ./manage.py and receive the help output (and not a traceback). This sounds trivial but there is actually a lot of work involved to get to this point. Namely, figuring out how to make Puppet execute each of the required steps successfully, together. (You would expect to be able to just define the steps in order, but those with this expectation will be disappointed. I assume Puppet has their reasons, and they are probably even good ones. :-)) Get the VM running to the point where one can open http://33.33.33.10:8000 from the host to see kitsune running. Once step #1 is done, this is actually easier than it sounds because I'm \"cheating\". Test data has been imported and a syncdb has been run, but I'm using supervisor to manage the runserver process (for now). Get the VM running like it does in production. This will involve configuring Apache and mod_wsgi as well as resolving any issues that remain with the app. I'll rely on the kitsune team to help with this, as I'm still learning the app. This is the \"exciting\" part for me because I get to learn something new. While Vagrant and Puppet are also new to me, I consider these technologies part of my \"past life\" (as a system administrator) and Django sites part of my \"future life\" (as a web developer). Now about the technologies. Vagrant I had heard of Vagrant before, but never tried it. I am now sorry I waited so long because the \"cool factor\" is very high. It requires that Virtualbox be installed, which I also danced around for too long before committing (being a former Parallels user). On OS X Lion[1], installing Vagrant is simply a matter of: $ gem install vagrant Once you have `vagrant` installed you can do: $ vagrant init inside some revision-controlled directory and you have the beginnings of a virtual machine you can share with the masses. This is how kitsune-vagrant was born. Hopefully this shared virtual machine will eventually make some new developer's life much easier. We now arrive at a fork in the road; though Vagrant makes it easy to follow both paths: Chef or Puppet (it supports both). I don't recall what made me choose Puppet over Chef, but it might have been that the Socorro folks were using it already . Once you decide on Puppet (and assuming you do), it's pretty easy to figure out that your next move is to create a manifest file for Puppet to apply[2]. Puppet My knowledge of Puppet is currently quite limited. Specifically, I only know how to create a manifest file. (Vagrant does the rest!) I imagine there is much more to Puppet, especially with regard to doing actual configuration management on production servers. But I have not explored any of that yet. However, I did learn quite a bit about Puppet just from writing the manifest. The first most important thing I learned is this: Puppet is in charge . It does things the way it wants to and you need to follow its rules. The first and biggest challenge is to achieve a linear execution of tasks. You cannot write rules in order and hope for the best. This will fail spectacularly when something executes before something else was supposed to. The way around this is via `require =>` statements. A grep through kitsune.pp reveals: require => Exec['git_clone'], require => Exec['db_sync'], require => Exec['packages_upgrade'], require => Exec['packages_update'], require => Package[$packages_native], require => Exec['git_clone'], require => Exec['chown_kitsune'], require => Exec['packages_compiled'], require => Exec['packages_vendor'], require => Exec['db_create'], require => Exec['db_import'], require => file['/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf'], require => Exec['supervisor_stop'], This roughly translates to the following workflow logic: Ensure that `aptitude -y update; aptitude -y upgrade` have been run before you try to install the list of packages we require. Ensure the list of packages we require is installed before we checkout the code. Ensure the code has been checked out (and pip install / git submodule have been run) before you try to syncdb and run the application. There is a bit more to it, but with that knowledge you should be able to read and understand kitsune.pp in full . I learned most of the remaining required puppeteering from this site: http://www.puppetcookbook.com/ . Mozilla Oh my! This Mozilla work is a ton of fun[3]; I attribute this in part due to the structure of their organization: I was invited immediately to collaborate in IRC with the kitsune team and as a result, we all have something to show for it[4]. Next I will be working on the 3rd milestone! Hope to finish by the end of this week. Notes [1] This did not work on Snow Leopard, because `gem` is too old. However if you `brew install ruby` and try again, it should work. [2] I didn't bother to investigate Chef, but I am curious about it. [3] And I hope this is only the beginning. [4] I hope to get a Mozilla gig but even if I don't, being able to do this type of work is very rewarding (which is why you will often hear people in open source say that to get paid for the type of work they do is a dream come true :-)).","tags":"Blog","title":"Vagrant, Puppet and Mozilla, oh my!"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/09/22/mozilla-and-pypi/","text":"The last time I wrote about PyPI some folks mistook the subject to be PyPy , so let me be clear: this article is about the Python Packaging Index . I recently began doing some volunteer work for Mozilla[1], working on a virtual machine setup to make kitsune development easier (kitsune is the code name for the Django site that powers support.mozilla.com ). Git submodules In doing so, I came across an interesting command from their installation docs : $ git submodule update --init --recursive I can recall some vague rumblings about git submodules prior to this incident, but nothing I'd call \"familiarity\". So, I shrugged it off and went about the business of creating the VM (and resisting the urge to use zc.buildout to do it): On day 1, I created a VirtualBox VM using the latest Ubuntu Server and was able to assemble and run the application by following the instructions. On day 2, I began to \"vagrantize\" the process. Here I ran into a bit of trouble with the git-submodule command[2]. This led me to seek alternative methods to install the various Python packages it was trying to install (when stuck on a problem I often like to pursue the alternatives immediately, so I have them if I need them.) Zamboni Then, in the Mozilla IRC channel #sumodev ( su pport mo zilla) some nice Mozillian (willkg) pointed me to this gem: http://mozweb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/packaging.html Which in turn led me to the following two links: http://jbalogh.github.com/zamboni/topics/packages/ http://playdoh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/packages.html#packages Again, faint rumblings… this time about zamboni (not THAT Zamboni). I know I've heard of it, but I wouldn't call myself familiar with it. So, I innocently read the following: Python projects can incur a number of dependencies. ``pip`` can be handy, but we've had better luck with distributing a ``vendor`` library. At which point I immediately thought to myself: Yeah… I hear that. Followed a few seconds later by: Wait… what?!? Playdoh Some time/research later[3], I (re)discovered that zamboni is the codename for addons.mozilla.org [4]. And Playdoh is the code name for Mozilla's base Django project setup. If you aren't familiar with Playdoh, please do give it a whirl[5]. PyPI While all of this is very, very interesting to me, I am primarily a \"systems and processes\" guy; and what ultimately stuck with me after two days of Mozilla-ing is the following blurb from the Playdoh packaging documentation: The ``/vendor`` library is supposed to contain all packages and repositories. It enables the project to be deployed as one package onto many machines, without relying on PyPI-based installations on each target machine. \"Nooooooooooooooo\", I am now saying to myself over and over. \"Without relying on PyPI-based installations on each target machine.\" Another \"noooooooooooooooo!\" :-) I certainly don't fault Mozilla for taking this approach, but it makes me sad that large organizations like Mozilla are passing over PyPI in favor of alternative methods of distributing Python software. Let us all now hang our heads, for a moment of pause and reflection. [a minute passes] The future I can't speak for anyone else, but I would certainly like to see this change in the future. I would LOVE to see PyPI become a place that Mozilla felt confident it could use to deploy Python software. And this is something I'd love to work on for Mozilla, if given the opportunity[6]. Great for Python == great for Mozilla? It's obvious what's in it for Python, but what's in for Mozilla? Simple. I happen to share Mozilla's vision for an open web and open source in general. And it's great to see them embracing & using Python for their web projects! Without a doubt, they are interested in giving back to the Python community (e.g. via Playdoh and the Django community, in this case.) So I suspect they'd be open to helping the Python community fix a long standing issue: the stability and reliability of the Python Package Index. It would certainly benefit them in the long run to simplify their build process to the point where git-submodule was no longer needed[7]. Notes [1] I am actively courting Mozilla in hopes of landing a gig by the end of the year. So all you Mozillians who know me personally, please put in a good word! And all you Mozillians I have not met yet: nice to meet you! :-) [2] The problem turned out to be git-submodule failing to run because things like: grep and sed were missing from the PATH. Easily fixed by modifying the puppet configuration, but not easily discovered because git-submodule itself returned zero! Some guy on #puppet was very helpful in getting me to print out debug info. [3] More help from friendly Mozillians in #webdev: 11:13 < groovecoder> aclark: yeah, zamboni is amo 11:13 < kumar> playdoh was extracted from zamboni and other apps 11:13 < kumar> but zamboni itself does not eat the playdoh dog food, actually 11:15 < kumar> aclark also, in case you're not steeped in our initialisms, amo is addons.mozilla.org [4] There is a great presentation about it here: http://www.slideshare.net/andymckay/anatomy-of-a-large-django-site-7590098 .) [5] More from kumar (emphasis is my own): 11:25 < kumar> Playdoh is starting to stabilize so it would be good to see some use of it outside Mozilla ; this would probably help us catch Mozilla-specific things that need extraction [6] LARGE HINT ;-) [7] Again, not that there is anything wrong with what Mozilla is doing here. As a systems guy, I just happen to gravitate toward simplifying processes by eliminating steps.","tags":"Blog","title":"Mozilla and PyPI"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/08/28/hello-mod_wsgi/","text":"It seems I've inadvertently started another series of blog entry: the \"hello world\" series, wherein I explain how to easily get started with various exciting Python technologies . This time, in order to familiarize myself with mod_wsgi , I've created a buildout to automate some of the processes explained in: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/QuickInstallationGuide (This series also helps me to subtly introduce the zc.buildout \"extendables\" I have been working on. More on those in a future post.) The extendables The extendables make it easy to bootstrap a development environment with complex software requirements, via zc.buildout . In this case, I want to be able to type: $ test-apache test-dir And get a working, disposable Apache instance minutes later. I also want that Apache to come with a mod_wsgi app installed and working. Setup First we use the aforementioned extendable , like so: $ virtualenv test-dir $ cd test-dir $ bin/pip install zc.buildout $ bin/buildout init Edit the buildout.cfg to look like this: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/pythonpackages/buildout-apache-modwsgi/master/2.2.x Run buildout: $ bin/buildout Assuming successful completion, you should be able to run Apache in the foreground via: $ bin/supervisord -e debug -n Now check http://localhost:8080 . This works because the \"extendable\" (buildout configuration file) contains: The little WSGI app from the QuickInstallationGuide, templatized via collective.recipe.template . A templatized httpd.conf file . I like to automate the process even further with the following script : #!/bin/shmkdir $1 virtualenv-2.6 $1 cd $1 bin/easy_install zc.buildout bin/buildout init cat << EOF > buildout.cfg [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/pythonpackages/buildout-apache-modwsgi/master/2.2.x EOF bin/buildout bin/supervisord -e debug -n Thus closing the loop on this blog entry, and making the following possible: $ test-apache test-dir I've been using my test-plone script for years now, and I'm hoping that the test-apache script proves just as useful (especially as Plone moves closer to a WSGI-supporting stack via Zope 2.13 ).","tags":"Blog","title":"Hello mod_wsgi"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/08/20/hello-plone/","text":"This is a Plone \"Hello, World!\" style tutorial/application for Python programmers.

Warning This is not a particularly good example since a template can be specified via ZCML. However once you understand hello_plone you will understand the difference between the two approaches. Step 1 - Setup Create a directory called hello_plone and inside it create a virtualenv : $ mkdir hello_plone $ cd hello_plone $ virtualenv-2.7 . Then install Buildout: $ bin/pip install zc.buildout Then create an empty buildout: $ bin/buildout init Then add a Plone buildout: [buildout] extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/plone-4-3 Now run Buildout: $ bin/buildout And start Plone: $ bin/plone fg Open http://localhost:8080 .

Step 2 - Develop Plone is customized via Python packages called Add-ons (née Products). So first we need to create a Python package: $ mkdir -p my.app/my/app $ touch my.app/my/app/__init__.py $ touch my.app/my/__init__.py Next we add our Python package to the buildout.

The eggs line makes Plone aware of it: [buildout] develop = ./my.app extends = https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/plone-4-3 [plone] eggs += my.app Now we can add some view code: from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile from zope.publisher.browser import BrowserPage class Hello(BrowserPage): \"\"\" \"\"\" template = ViewPageTemplateFile('hello.pt') def __call__(self): return self.template() And load the view code via ZCML : <configure xmlns:browser=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/browser\"> <browser:page class=\".hello.hello\" for=\"*\" name=\"hello\" permission=\"zope2.View\" /> </configure> And add a template : <div metal:use-macro=\"here/main_template/macros/master\"> <div metal:fill-slot=\"main\"> <h1>Hello world!</h1> </div> </div> Step 3 - Next steps Easy through-the-web form generation with PloneFormGen .

This in and of itself is not-so-terribly newsworthy. What is interesting, though, is how this new customized form came to be; and how its features compare to the default contact form. So here goes: In Plone, we have a page template called contact-info.cpt . It's not so special (in that it is pretty feature- less , though it will send mail if you ask it to) but it does the job for most folks. And it almost has to, because customizing it is beyond the realm of what anyone would call \"straight forward\" or \"reasonable to expect from TTW customizers, integrators, or even developers\"¹. Why do I say this? Been there, done that: CMFFormController First, let me start with the technology that is used to implement the contact form. It's called CMFFormController and it went out of style in the 1970s, along with disco and bell bottoms. Bell bottoms came back, but CMFFormController didn't! Don't get me wrong: CMFFormController is a decent technology/implementation. It works. But it's not very \"modern\" by today's coding standards. As such, it will simply be dragged along Plone-version-after-Plone-version until either: a.) someone wants to replace it, or b.) it becomes too big of a maintenance burden to support and someone has to replace it. This is the way of many things, and there is nothing inherently wrong with this phenomenon. In fact, there are even good things about it: e.g. the release manager, framework team, and core developers' ability to publish release-after-solid-release under such code-aging circumstances is a testament to their skill and dedication. BUT… and this is a BIG BUT. We can do better Leaving this old stuff laying around, with no new stuff to point new users to does a huge disservice to all of our users. It flies directly in the face of one of our core missions: as Wyn Williams put it once, to be the \"best damn enterprise content manage system on the planet\". Now, I've been around the block, so I am not suggesting we must fix everything at once. Legacy software can be supported for years and years and years (and YEARS ). What I am suggesting is that we need to make a very significant effort to COMPLETELY HIDE these implementation details to newcomers. I don't want to tell people in IRC to go to portal_skins anymore. I want my \"OS X Lion release for Plone\", please (sans Vista overtones.) :-) So how do we get there? Well, in the case of portal_skins there is talk of decommissioning portal_view_customizations, which was supposed to be the \"new portal_skins\" as I understand it. But since half of our templates are still in CMF skin layers, and because this feature was not technically well received (i.e. it needs more features and development), and because portal_resources came along around the same time as plone.app.theming , folks are considering removing portal_view_customizations. I have no strong opinion about it (other than I hate the name, too long) and I trust the Framework Team to handle it. What I do care about is that whatever remains in the ZMI be very clearly designated as either \"new style\" or \"old style\". We can't get away from the ZMI yet, but portal tools do have title attributes so let's use them. Now, we can't ditch portal_skins just yet, and who knows what will happen with portal_view_customizations , but the *minute* we know some technology is out of date, we should reveal it in the user interface (even in the ZMI user interface). E.g.: Curiously, the attribute that holds this string is lowercase \"title\" (I'd expect camel case Description, though I'm not entirely sure why I expect that.) Hanno Schlichting has made some great progress recently with enhancing the ZMI for Plone users, especially with regard to file-system vs. through-the-web development, and through-the-plone vs. through-the-zmi configuration . I love this trend, and would like to see more of it! Secrets revealed Anyway, I've been dancing around the secrets to be revealed in this blog post because it is fun to play with the future. And it's important to work hard toward achieving it. But enough of that, here is what you need to know today. Like I said, I customized the contact form. Old style vs. new style Back in the \"old days\" you had to create a CMF skin layer and put a copy of the template in a directory on the file system, configured as a File System Directory View. Everything used to be customized via skin layers. Now-a-days, we have z3c.jbot. Though a bit of a hack², it does exactly what you'd expect, almost exactly how you'd expect it to. It doesn't even require a Python package . By convention though, folks typically do put z3c.jbot template customizations in Python packages. This requires a few steps. Step 1: Create a Python package First, a Python package. This is relatively simple, so I'm not going to skip-and-point-you-somewhere-else just yet, I'm going to explain first. The gist of it is this: $ mkdir -p my.package/my/package $ touch my.package/setup.py $ touch my.package/my/__init__.py $ touch my.package/my/package/__init__.py Now you would edit setup.py and the \"middle\" __init__.py with code. Something like this: #!/bin/sh mkdir -p my.package/my/package touch my.package/setup.py touch my.package/my/__init__.py touch my.package/my/package/__init__.py cat > my.package/setup.py << EOF from setuptools import setup, find_packages setup( name='my.package', packages=find_packages(), namespace_packages=[ 'my', ] ) EOF cat > my.package/my/__init__.py << EOF from pkg_resources import declare_namespace declare_namespace(__name__) EOF Alternatively, use ZopeSkel to generate all this boilerplate code for you. It does a much better, and more complete job than what I have done here. The important thing is that you understand what is going on . In the case of aclark.net, our Python package is called plonetheme.aclarknet . Step 2: Add template overrides Now that we have a Python package we can start customizing Plone. By convention, we create a \"templates\" directory inside the namespaced package e.g.: $ mkdir my.package/my/package/templates Or you can check out aclark.net's \"templates\" directory here: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/tree/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/templates Because of the way z3c.jbot works, in the \"templates\" directory, we add files with names that correspond to the Python module we want to customize. E.g. https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/templates/Products.CMFPlone.skins.plone_templates.contact-info.cpt (For some reason, github thinks that file is binary, so here are the contents .) Now, this is the amazing part: in addition to templates in views, viewlets and portlets, we can customize any CMF object! E.g. the RestrictedPython (more technology anyone?) CMFFormController validation script used to validate our contact form: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/templates/Products.CMFPlone.skins.plone_form_scripts.validate_site_feedback.vpy That brings us to adding recaptcha, but first let us finish configuring template overrides. Step 3: Configure template overrides Now that we have customized Plone templates, we can configure Plone to use our customizations. This is done via a technology you may have heard of: ZCML . Using ZCML, we can tell Plone (or jbot in this case) to use the templates in our \"templates\" directory. The ZCML we are going to use is placed in the \"top level\" configure.zcml file in our package. That means we need a top level configure.zcml file: $ touch my.package/my/package/configure.zcml Next we add ZCML to \"configure our application\". Note in addition to the ZCML used to configure jbot, there is ZCML for Diazo and ZCML to hold our Genericsetup customizations: <configure xmlns:browser=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/browser\" xmlns:genericsetup=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/genericsetup\" xmlns:plone=\"http://namespaces.plone.org/plone\" xmlns=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/zope\"> <plone:static directory=\"theme/aclarknet\" type=\"theme\" /> <include package=\"z3c.jbot\" file=\"meta.zcml\" /> <browser:jbot directory=\"templates\" /> <genericsetup:registerProfile name=\"default\" title=\"ACLARK.NET, LLC profile\" description=\"Installs ACLARK.NET, LLC site customizations\" directory=\"profiles/default\" provides=\"Products.GenericSetup.interfaces.EXTENSION\" /></configure> This file is located here: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/configure.zcml You can see that everything inside the <configure></configure> tag(s) is associated with an XML namespace. If you don't add the appropriate namespace inside the <configure> tag, your configuration will fail spectacularly (because without the proper XML namespace configured, there is no code loaded to handle your configuration.) Step 4: Add recaptcha Now, finally, we get to the exciting part. We have customized our contact form, but we are receiving a fair amount of spam due to spammers' ability to automate form submission. To foil the spammers, we want to add a captcha form that will hopefully require that an actual human to fill out the form. Thanks to David Glick and Groundwire, we have collective.recaptcha which provides an integration of Google's Recaptcha service into Plone. In order to use it, first we add the package to our buildout, e.g.: … [plone] # Eggs are Python packages eggs += # Diazo theming plonetheme.aclarknet # Add-ons collective.portlet.wordpress collective.recaptcha# Need zcml for c.recaptcha until 1.1.3 is released zcml = collective.recaptcha … See the rest of the file here: https://raw.github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/master/buildout.cfg Now run buildout and restart Plone. With collective.recaptcha installed via buildout, you should now be able to open http://yoursite:8080/Plone/@@recaptcha-settings to configure Recaptcha. (To get a public and private key, you can sign up for recaptcha here: http://www.google.com/recaptcha ) Lastly, make the appropriate changes to the contact form and validation script. E.g. include the captcha image: … <tal:block tal:replace=\"structure context/@@captcha/image_tag\"/> … And make sure to validate the submission : … # Re-captcha validation if not context.restrictedTraverse('@@captcha').verify(): context.plone_utils.addPortalMessage(_(u'You entered an invalid captcha.'), 'error') return state.set(status='failure') else: return state … That's it! Notes ¹ I'm pushing \"reasonable\" limits here for argument's sake. For those who know Plone already, a lot of what might seem impossible to newcomers is \"reasonable\" for them. No flames please. Unless you absolutely must. ;-) ² I hear people call it that, though I don't know the details. I assume it \"monkey patches\" which template to use at render-time.","tags":"Blog","title":"Plone secrets: Episode 3 - Collective Recaptcha installation"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/07/06/plone-secrets-episode-2-collective-python-buildout/","text":"You know who uses the (Plone) Collective Python buildout? Me neither, because we don't have any good statistics on its use (that I know of). If it were a Python package, we could at least count the number of times it has been downloaded . You know who should use it? Everyone. [dramatic pause…] OK maybe not everyone, but at least everyone that regularly develops with multiple versions of Python . Here's why. Actively maintained Check out the log. It has been going strong for over 3 years. If I recall correctly, it was born out of the frustration¹ of having to compile Python on Mac OS X Leopard. Python never compiles correctly on new versions of OS X (which is a complete mystery to me given that Apple ships with Python, don't they think people will want to compile it?). Easy to install Got Subversion? Then you can haz the Collective Python buildout². You will also need to bootstrap it with whatever Python version you happen to have laying around. I won't go into detail about this; but suffice it to say depending on your OS, one of the following or something like it should work: $ aptitude install python2.5 Or: $ brew install python If you are on Windows, give up (unless you have a Microsoft C compiler). Sorry. Now, check out the code from the repository (if you are a member of the Collective and may potentially contribute something back, make sure you use https): $ svn co http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/python Next, bootstrap and run the buildout: $ cd python $ python bootstrap.py -d $ bin/buildout That's it. The buildout should go merrily on it's way compiling Python 2.4 through 3.2. When it finishes, you can install it in /opt (or wherever you like) with the following command (you might need sudo): $ bin/install-links Then you should see: $ /bin/ls -1 /opt/local/bin easy_install-2.4 easy_install-2.5 easy_install-2.6 easy_install-2.7 easy_install-3.2 pip-2.4 pip-2.5 pip-2.6 pip-2.7 pip-3.2 python2.4 python2.5 python2.6 python2.7 python3.2 virtualenv-2.4 virtualenv-2.5 virtualenv-2.6 virtualenv-2.7 virtualenv-3.2 Easy to configure Now you can add /opt/local/bin to your environment PATH variable. This will make it easy to choose a particular Python, PIP, or Virtualenv at your leisure. Unfortunately, if you pip install something, it will end up in the checkout instead of /opt/local/bin .

The goal is to describe a set of developer/integrator techniques that are extremely valuable, but completely non-obvious to newcomers. The first episode, called: Site actions contact link , is really just a technique that involves the Zope Management Interface, Plone interface, file system, Diazo, and quite possibly a few other technologies. This is no secret, but certainly convoluted. Noticeably absent is anything Python-related, unless you count the plonetheme.aclarknet namespace package. We begin by pointing your attention to the new \"Contact us today!\" link on aclark.net. This is a gratuitous rip off of any Plone firm's website that has contact info in the upper right of their site (e.g. http://sixfeetup.com ). I knew I wanted to do \"my version\" of adding contact info to the upper right, and I think I've seen someone use this exact technique somewhere else (I would credit them if I could remember.) Long story short: Plone 4's sunburst theme has a nice JavaScript drop down menu for the personal tools menu. As long as I was willing to give up a link to the login form (which I don't like displaying on public sites anyway), I could use this JavaScript menu to quickly and easily provide a link to my contact form. It \"only\" required the following: Step 1 Get the personal tools menu to show up in my site. This was accomplished via the following Diazo rule: <prepend content='//*[@id=\"portal-personaltools\"]' theme='//*[@id=\"search\"]' /> Note also that I am using the early-supported XPath syntax, but the more friendly CSS syntax is supported now too. See http://diazo.org for more information. For the full set of Diazo rules for this site, see here: Plone: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/theme/aclarknet/rules.xml Wordpress: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/theme/blog.xml Step 2 Next, we need to create and display only the \"Contact us today!\" link, which also involves disabling the \"Log in\" link. These tricks can be performed in the Zope Management Interface via the portal_actions tool. First, browse to Site Setup -> Zope Management Interface -> portal_actions -> user and create a contact action. Fill in the appropriate fields and click Save changes . Finally, hide the Log in action by unchecking Visible and clicking Save changes . Step 3 Lastly and most importantly, persist your work on the file system outside of the database. You don't want to be forced to recreate this site action ever again through the web. This involves exporting the action via portal setup, and adding it to your package's GenericSetup profile. Browse to Site Setup -> Zope Management Interface -> portal_setup -> Export. Check the `Action providers step. Then scroll all the way down to bottom and click Export selected steps . This will give you a tarred/gzipped file that when extracted will give you an actions.xml file. Edit this file to include only the action you created, like so: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> </object> </object> You can find this file in its entirety here: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/profiles/default/actions.xml You also have to register a default profile in your package with ZCML (more technology!), like so: <genericsetup:registerProfile name=\"default\" title=\"ACLARK.NET, LLC profile\" description=\"Installs ACLARK.NET, LLC site customizations\" directory=\"profiles/default\" provides=\"Products.GenericSetup.interfaces.EXTENSION\" /> You can find this file in its entirety here: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/configure.zcml Step 4 Style the results. This is more like Step 3.5, but still important. Because we are doing Diazo theming, styling is easy. It's just a matter of editing the style sheet on the file system like you would expect to do in any web project. Of course, you need to know a bit about CSS and the CSS ids that Plone uses: #personaltools-contact { color: #AA001F; background: white; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 150%; } #portal-personaltools { background: white; } You can find this file in its entirety here: https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclark_net_website/blob/master/src/plonetheme.aclarknet/plonetheme/aclarknet/theme/aclarknet/static/css/plone.css#L519 And of course, these styles apply to the public facing site. Results That's it! I hope this post captures the essence of why I think many folks may be intimidated by Plone: in more cases than not, one must understand way too many technologies in order to get the job done. I hope to continue to demystify Plone through a series of \"Plone secrets\" posts, and ultimately I think the Plone project hopes to resolve these issues once and for all, however long that takes. I will speculate that long term Plone will move away from Zope 2, and everything from the Zope Management Interface that was useful will be recreated in Plone (i.e. ported). Or rather, that is what I would like to see happen.","tags":"Blog","title":"Plone Secrets Episode 1 Site Actions Contact Link"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/06/16/youre-so-vain-so-why-not-use-vanity/","text":"A few months ago I created a package called Vanity [0] that provides easy access to package download statistics from PyPI . You can find the source code here: https://github.com/aclark4life/vanity . I love this tool, and I use it all the time to gauge the value of a package. Of course, downloads are only one criteria you can use to judge the value of a package, and arguably not even a very good one. Vanity itself is a good example of this phenomenon. I find it incredibly useful, but in it's history it has only been downloaded 130 times. Other packages I have created with much less value have been downloaded more times, e.g. plonetheme.aclark_twitter which has been downloaded 674 times. But that package has also been around much longer. So obviously another useful metric would be the time period during which the downloads occurred. Anyway, here is how it works: $ easy_install vanity Then: $ vanity <package> For example: $ vanity vanity Package `vanity` has been downloaded 130 times! Or: $ vanity plonetheme.aclark_twitter Package `plonetheme.aclark_twitter` has been downloaded 674 times! Some of my other favorites: $ vanity Django[1] Package `Django` has been downloaded 302111 times! $ vanity zope.component Package `zope.component` has been downloaded 210541 times! $ vanity pyramid Package `pyramid` has been downloaded 26067 times! Another thing to consider is if hitting PyPI each time is really necessary. I'm told there is PyPI data living somewhere else, and in future versions I would like to make vanity use that data by default. So, this post is simply to announce Vanity to a wider audience in the event that some folks may find it useful. Otherwise, I will be happy to continue to watch Vanity downloads crawl ever so slowly towards 200. :-) Notes [0] By standing on the shoulders of some Plone giants, David Glick, in particular. [1] There is a known issue with regard to making Vanity case insensitive.","tags":"Blog","title":"You're so vain, so why not use Vanity?"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/06/14/aclarknet-seeks-unique-candidate-for-part-time-business-consulting/","text":"We are looking for a unique and talented (but mostly non-technical) individual that is passionate about Plone, and able to dedicate some small amount of time per month to generating new business for us[1]. Plone is up and coming (again)! And we want to (1.) capitalize on that fact and (2.) scale our business accordingly. But to do so, we really need your help. About us We are a team[2] of Python, Plone, Web, and Business savvy people focused on Python, Plone, the web, and generally speaking: deploying and maintaining Plone applications that range from CMS to specialized applications, tailored to fit the needs of our clients[3]. Alex For those of you that know me, you know that I am largely technically, very artistic, and focused a lot on systems and making-things-work (vs. programming), and that I am passionate to a fault about Plone and the Plone community. For those of you that don't know me, I'm responsible for all new business at ACLARK.NET and I am the technical lead on all of our projects. I also rock a maroon Japanese Fender Stratocaster (circa mid 1980s) on occasion. Amy My wife and business partner Amy is the \"business coordinator\" and she handles all things customer-related (that are non-technical) as well as anything legal and/or financial. If you know her, then you know she is a force to be reckoned with as well as one of the nicest, most professional people you will ever meet. If you don't know her, watch out! When she is not watching the bottom line, Amy can be found caring for our always-singing-while-she-is-on-the-phone yellow canary: J. Alexander Chirpington III. Team Team ACLARK also consists of a variety of highly skilled sub contractors that always make us look good by making our clients happy, and hopefully have lots of fun doing it. Business To date, other than constantly \"pimping\" (promoting) myself personally (on behalf of my company) within the Plone community, we have never actively sought out any business. And we manage to stay quite busy with the work that finds us. But it has occurred to us that in order to compete most effectively with \"the big boys\" (i.e. all our friends/colleagues/etc at http://plone.net ) we need to be more pro-active about seeking out new business. That's where you come in. About you We need someone to pursue leads on our behalf, because we simply don't have time to do it and we don't have anyone in-house that is particularly well-suited to the task. However, we don't want to let that stop us from growing our business and deploying as many Plone sites as possible; especially when we are confident we have the ability to deliver on just about any kind of Plone-related project, and then some (i.e. Django, Pyramid, etc., almost anything Python-related.) Criteria First and foremost, you love (and use) Plone (but aren't necessarily an integrator/developer; most likely an end user). But also: You are a \"people person\". You have some writing skills, perhaps even a technical writer. You are aggressive about scoring new business, perhaps even someone with a sales background. You are a professional, and will represent us and our business accordingly! Also nice to have: You have a full-time job that is Plone-related. You have experience writing proposals. You don't necessarily have to \"know everything\" to do this job effectively for us, but you do have to be excited and pro-active about it. Logistics We don't know how this will work yet. We are certainly willing to pay a percentage of the anticipated bid value for any bid we win, but we are considering other options as well. Next step Sound like you? Let's talk: aclark@aclark.net , 301-312-5236. We look forward to hearing from you, and please feel free to pass this information on to anyone you think may be interested in this opportunity.

Even something as small as 8 hours per month would be helpful. http://aclark.net/team http://aclark.net/clients","tags":"Blog","title":"ACLARK.NET seeks unique candidate for part time business consulting"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/05/27/new-plone-theming-has-arrived/","text":"Edit2: Enfold/Ploud.net looking for theme developers, see Alan Runyan's comment below. Edit : Laurence Rowe made new Diazo and plone.app.theming releases so the zip file now works! Thanks Laurence. Due to the new Diazo theming features now available, I am very excited about the recent release of Plone 4.1rc2 and plone.app.theming 1.0b2 . So much so, I created a couple themes (in just a few hours) to demonstrate my rapture [1] : (released) http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plonetheme.unilluminated/0.1.0 (unreleased) https://github.com/aclark4life/plonetheme.coolblue Granted, these aren't entirely \"finished\" (e.g. lots of CSS improvements are needed) but it is truly impressive how much you can do with so little effort (thanks to the hard work of the Diazo team, Plone team, and of course the theme designers themselves). The best part has got to be the zip file packaging features in plone.app.theming (provided by plone.resource ). While I did have a bit of trouble getting my zip file to work, I suspect I'll get that issue resolved this week (I don't think I was able to import any zipped themes, even the ones from p.a.theming tests). Suprise! I like it What I am most surprised about is how much I like this approach: Developers can easily distribute themes in Python packages, and pay a much smaller \"theming tax\" with new style Diazo theming. They can also optionally choose to distribute Diazo themes as zip files for easy public consumption (although I can't think of any good, automated way to publish just the zip files.) If I am not mistaken the contents of a zipped theme can be loaded quite elegantly , without changing their contents, via a Python package . So, let us now commence the spamming of PyPI and the Plone.org downloads section with \"fun\" easy-to-install (read: no buildout) Plone themes! [2] Disclaimer These are my experiences with relatively new Plone technologies. If I've made a mistake or if your experiences are different, please let me know in the comments. [1] Please forgive gratuitous belated rapture humor. [2] Before you get upset over any suggested spamming, I only mean to suggest that the ability to distribute a theme as a zip file lowers the bar to Plone adoption tremendously. Personally (and tentatively, since I'm not even sure if everything is meant to work the way I currently expect it to), I plan to include a zipped archive of any theme I distribute as a Python package because it is so easy to do so (or hopefully will be very soon). But how the community chooses to capitalize on this new-found ability remains to be seen.","tags":"Blog","title":"\"New\" Plone theming has arrived"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/05/10/top-10-reasons-plone-33-site-admin-book-is-still-for-you/","text":"About a year ago, I was frantically trying to finish Plone 3.3 Site Administration in time to teach it at Plone Symposium East 2010 at Penn State University as well as publish it. I remember staying up all night to finish & submit the final drafts then driving 4 hours to Penn State, then teaching for 8 hours before I was finally able to crash (but not before consuming a large and delicious cheeseburger and a Yuengling from the Nittany Lion Inn room service, yum). The class went well and everyone seemed happy with the results and I am very grateful to PSU for the opportunity. I remember struggling to get some Windows users up to speed, so this year I've decided to \"require\" students to install Plone before the class via the appropriate installer for their platform . Most \"site admin-ing\" we do will be \"ad hoc\" preferably on top of a stand-alone Python installation. But we can refer to the installer-based Plone as needed and in fact the installer-based Plone is all some folks will ever need or want. The list Anyway, this post is about this year's class taught from the same material but updated to account for any changes that have occurred since the book was first published. Most importantly, it addresses the release of Plone 4 in the context of the book title \"Plone 3.3 Site Administration\". So without further ado, why \"Plone 3.3 Site Administration\" is still for you: The version reference in the title is mostly meaningless . PACKT insist on incorporating a software version number into the title of their books. I would have called it: \"Plone Site Administration\", or \"Buildout for Plone\". The book teaches valuable *techniques*, using Plone 3.3 as an example . Most, if not all of the techniques still apply today i.e. w/Plone 4.0.x and Plone 4.1.x. They will likely continue to apply as long as Plone continues to rely on zc.buildout . Plone makes it relatively easy to upgrade by providing version numbers for all of the packages it requires. In many cases an upgrade simply involves referring to a newer list of package versions. In the case of upgrading from Plone 3.3.x to Plone 4.0.x, the [zope2] section goes away because Zope2 became an egg. (Compare this buildout with this one .) Also Plone 4 buildouts should be bootstrapped with Python 2.6 instead of Python 2.4 as was required by Plone 3. Python tools \"goodness\" . This book goes to great lengths to demonstrate how Plone fits \"naturally\" on top of the Python software stack. It also includes information about non-Plone-specific Python-related technologies like Setuptools and pip . This in theory makes Plone more approachable to \"regular\" Python folk. The Python buildout . One of the most useful things the Plone community has to offer the Python community at large is the Python buildout . If you do development that requires multiple versions of Python e.g. Plone 3.3.x/4.0.x you could do worse than to rely on this buildout to provide them multiple versions quickly and easily. The book dances around the subject, but the point is: use it. Cross-platform . This book goes to great lengths to demonstrate the Plone installation process on three popular operating systems: Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows. The point is to show off how similar the process is across platforms because Python does all the hard work, and of course to deal with the cases where it is not similar e.g. it's \"hard\" to compile Python on Windows . Add-ons ! A lot of the value of Plone comes from the ability to customize it to fit your needs. If that customization has already been done by some other member of the community, even better. This is one of the core essences of the Plone community: everyone working hard to contribute to the available pool of add-ons, and then sharing the results . This book aims to make you better at evaluating the myriad of options you may be presented with when you need to find and install an add-on . Upgrades ! The final chapter of the book holds your hand and walks you through an upgrade from Plone 3.3.x to Plone 4.0.x. It doesn't contain anything you can't find at http://plone.org/upgrade (in fact it contains much less information), but in the context of a book full of buildout configuration file examples, it should feel more like a natural step than an intimidating process. Security ! The book covers how to deal with security patches, not in the common case of when a hotfix is released as a Zope 2 Product or Python egg, but in the somewhat more obscure case where a newer (non-egg) Zope2 release replaces an older one with a vulnerability. The modern equivalent would be a Plone release post-security-hotfix release. Such releases simply contain a newer KGS listing package versions that contain the appropriate fixes. This \"old school\" example is included to give readers as broad a perspective as possible, so that they may better handle anything they may come across in the wild. All the boring stuff too . This book also walks you through the remaining \"hot\" topics not covered yet in this list, all from a heavy zc.buildout configuration management perspective: site basics e.g. customizing navigation, appearance (AKA theming, strictly \"old style\" sorry), administration e.g. mail settings, ldap, deployment and maintenance e.g. automating database backups and packing, and optimization e.g. load balancing, supervisor, and munin graphs ! That's it! The training Sound even the slightest bit interesting? And/or are these things you need to know about Plone for your job? If so, then you or your employees will not want to miss my one day class next week at the Plone Symposium East 2011 . In case you or your employees are interested, you can sign up here (separate from the symposium): http://aclark.net/services Hope to see you there. The service BaaS (Buildout as a Service) (Yes, I am serious) And finally for whatever it is worth, many of the lessons learned from writing the book from the author's perspective ended up here: https://github.com/plock/pins That is to say: buildouts are frequently changing in response to what is going on in the Python package ecosystem around them even though their primary goal is to maintain stability and/or to only change when you want to change. When a change like a security fix or configuration change comes along, the author pushes changes out to the dist server than deploys the dist server changes to production.","tags":"Blog","title":"Top 10 reasons Plone 3.3 Site Admin book is still for you"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/05/03/plone-conference-2008-is-a-wrap/","text":"Embarrassingly, I have yet to finish my obligations to the life-changing Plone Conference 2008 until NOW: approximately 2 years, 6 months, and 23 days after the end of the post-conference sprint.

Since I began drinking the collective.transmogrifier Kool Aid a few months back, I've gotten quite excited about the possibility of being able to use it outside Plone, i.e. like \"regular\" Python people would do. It just so happens I have a current project that requires me to import content to Plone 2.5; it took me a while to realize I could just setup a Plone 4 instance, run transmogrifier in it, and import content from it (i.e. from the file system) to Plone 2.5 over XML-RPC. But something about having to include Plone 4 in that scenario rubbed me the wrong way: Plone 4 is not needed, it's just executing the pipeline. (I also don't like the idea of having to create a Python package and a GenericSetup profile in order to facilitate a migration.) Goals So in addition to working on getting mr.migrator to be able to configure and execute pipelines (currently only GenericSetup profiles and Python code are supported), I thought I'd experiment with removing the CMFCore dependency. The initial, experimental results can be seen in action here: https://github.com/aclark4life/mr_migrator_demo From the README : Introduction ============ This demo is:* Proof of concept for mr.migrator: A tool that provides the ability to register and execute collective.transmogrifier pipelines without creating a Python package. It's Miller Time™.* Also proof of concept for collective.transmogrifier with the CMFCore dependency removed (and a zope.component dependency added in its place). It's Scotch time™. Explanation ----------- In order to work, it currently relies on:* https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.transmogrifier/branches/aclark-mr-migrator-compat * https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/transmogrify.filesystem/branches/aclark-mr-migrator-compat * git@github.com:aclark4life/transmogrify.ploneremote.git These are, respectively:* A branch of c.transmogrifier with a setuptools entry point plugin system added, and the CMFCore dependencies removed (gracefully, I hope).* A branch of t.filesystem with the collective.transmogrifier entry point specified (and some CMFCore dependencies removed).* A fork of t.ploneremote with the collective.transmogrifier entry point specified (and some CMFCore dependencies remove). … It's a work in progress, but it actually imports content. You may try it locally, as explained in the rest of the README : Installation ------------ You can try out this demo:: $ git clone git@github.com:aclark4life/mr_migrator_demo.git $ cd mr_migrator_demo $ python bootstrap.py $ bin/buildout Elsewhere, setup a Plone site listenining on localhost:8080 with a Plone site object called \"Plone\" and then: $ bin/mr.migrator You should end up with content in Plone that looks like this: … I hope this helps move the state of the art forward a bit; it would be great to share this technology with the rest of the Python world.

Some time later (last year or so) the client decided they wanted to scoop up even more content from the file system (we only grabbed the last few years prior to launch!) Unfortunately, the old migration code was truly a horror. So I've been having a hard time making myself run it again (I was just learning Python at the time.) About charm This is where charm comes in; formerly mr.importer , formerly parse2plone . Get it? The third time is a… I had the \"big idea\" to rewrite, then open source the code I wrote for the client. Unfortunately, the rewrite became a horror too. First, it was not well received amongst the more reusable approaches based on collective.transmogrifier , and rightfully so. While it was unpleasant to be told I was heading in the wrong direction, it was *even more* unpleasant to find out \"they\" were right. :-) Second, as \"they\" predicted, I got to the point where I couldn't read or maintain it any more (and I *just* wrote it). So, I decided to revert to a version which had much fewer configuration options, because making it configurable became a huge distraction. What's left is: The code is \"readable\", for some value of readable (PEP8/pyflakes compliant) and it's in a single module: charm.py . The concept is \"simple\", for some value of simple; it's a recipe that creates a script for you, that you run via: $ bin/plone run bin/charm /path/to/files The results are \"impressive\" for some value of impressive; it imports content from the file system into Plone: 2011-03-21 11:51:20,302 - charm - INFO - Imported 19 folders, 1 images, 20 pages, and 2 files. It won't crash (!), for some value of \"keeps going\"; it tries to do try/except on operations more likely to fail e.g. create_parts (via --ignore-errors). This aims to ensure you at least get some content in your site post-execution. $ bin/plone run bin/charm html --ignore-errors ... 2011-03-22 07:24:32,821 - charm - INFO - creating folder 'id' inside parent folder '/Plone' 2011-03-22 07:24:32,822 - charm - INFO - Keep going! Ignoring error 'The id \"id\" is invalid - it is already in use.' It has some tests, 34% coverage at the time of this writing: 619 34% charm (/Users/aclark/Developer/charm/charm.py) Has \"cool\" features, for some value of cool. Most notably, the \"collapse\" feature (AKA \"slugify\"): $ bin/plone run bin/charm html --collapse ... 2011-03-22 07:13:28,673 - charm - INFO - path 'html/2011/01/01/test-collapse', has subdirs '', and files 'index.html' ... 2011-03-22 07:13:28,693 - charm - INFO - object 'test-collapse-20110101.html' does not exist inside '/Plone' 2011-03-22 07:13:28,693 - charm - INFO - creating page 'test-collapse-20110101.html' inside parent folder '/Plone' And the \"publish\" feature to optionally publish content after creation: $ bin/plone run bin/charm html --collapse --publish ... 2011-03-22 07:13:29,008 - charm - INFO - publishing page 'test-collapse-20110101.html' And a few more things, but as you can see we are quickly approaching the point where more functionality does not necessarily mean better software. It's hard to build something complex AND make it easy to use, which is why I am moving on. Charming demo In writing this blog entry and releasing charm 1.0b4 I wanted to make sure to demonstrate how it works, so here is a screencast. This is how I envision content importing should work in Plone (or at least this is how I envision a \"simple\" way it could work.)

It was a beautiful location for a gathering of awesome Plone folks; and much was accomplished. Unfortunately on the second morning of the sprint, we were all deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Dorneles Treméa. The passing of Dorneles Treméa I didn't know Dorneles very well, but he was certainly someone I idolized during my initial Plone fascination days (e.g. \"Who are all these cool people with such cool names!\"). And after digging through my old emails, I now remember we had several pleasant exchanges over the years. Memories In particular, I have this memory of Dorneles and Alan Runyan sitting together at the Plone Conference 2008 sprint, smiling and working on their laptops. Before his death, it was just a random image that would occasionally pop into my head. Now, it's something I'll remember him by. We also corresponded briefly about his ExternalStorage add-on for Plone, around the time we upgraded plone.org from Plone 2.5 to Plone 3.0 (circa 2008), as well as traded emails about his invitation to attend Plone Conference 2008 in DC (for his visa application). The funniest thing he ever said to me was when I was making the rounds asking for donations for Plone Conference 2008. He replied, \"Are you aware that you're talking with a 3rd world citizen?\" I'm not sure if I offended him, or what. But it struck me funny at the time (and he went on to joke about how donations usually flow in the other direction, ending with his tongue stuck out i.e. \":-p\") :-). It also reminded me of one the things I love most about Plone: the opportunity (I may never get otherwise) to correspond/collaborate with cool, passionate people all over the world. To me, Dorneles was one of the living embodiments of the coolness and worldliness of the Plone project. Wishes My condolences and best wishes to his family, I hope you know how much he meant to so many folks in the Plone and Python communities. And just how many lives he touched with his work. And goodbye Dorneles; though I knew you very little, I will miss you very much. May your legacy live on, long in to the future. Incidentally, if you would like to give money to help support Dorneles' family in the aftermath of this tragedy, you can do so here: http://associacao.python.org.br/doacoes-familia-dorneles . Anyway, the sprint (or at least my part of it) was awesome! Amidst the very sad and shocking news of Dorneles' passing, we all kept busy with our work. Sprint report It's a bit overwhelming to try and capture everything that happened (and I was only there for two days!); hopefully this report will be useful. The focus of this sprint was evaluator approachability (i.e. making Plone look good to prospective new users). Day 1 and Day 2 Steve McMahon (SteveM) was our host. Alex Limi (limi) provided general direction regarding strategies to improve plone.net, documentation, and end user support. But most importantly, he pointed out that the first stop for any prospective new user is the website, so it's important that it look good. David Glick (davisagli) and Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy) wasted no time in diving in to the 150 or so open tickets in the (now defunct) plone.org issue tracker . I (aclark) quickly fell into the role of the \"deployment witch\" (a role I enjoy), and suggested people simply push the ACLARK button (née Staples Easy Button) whenever they needed their code deployed to plone.org. We closed a good number of tickets this way. Additionally: Ross Patterson (zenwryly) grabbed a hold of the PloneOrg add-on (the add-on that powers plone.org) and added tests (among other things). Tyler Randles (hennaheto) and Trish Ang (feeeeesh) fixed a number of CSS annoyances, which were committed by SteveM (while Tyler & Trish pondered core commit access). My favorite of which is the now-blissfully-aligned username and password fields of the login_form: zenwryly fixed the team section of plone.org. davisagli completed the last remaining task to fix PloneSoftwareCenter permissions on plone.org (the sharing tab finally works now!) limi fixed a CSS sprite issue on plone.org (involving https, I think). SteveM tackled SSL certificate issues on plone.org. aclark took a stab at plone.net by converting the old style add-on Product that powers it to a new style Egg package . zenwryly then took that ball and ran with it , added tests and otherwise prepared for the future (i.e. Plone 4 compat). Jon Stahl (remotely) added a \"follow\" section to plone.org. hennaheto and feeeeesh produced this amazing (but possibly non-compliant ) sprint logo Day 3, Day 4 and Day 5 Unfortunately, I had to leave on Friday morning but these are some of the things that happened after I left. Most importantly, Tom Kapanka (spanktar) arrived Thursday night and Bill Deegan arrived on Friday. And then: zenwryly updated PloneServicesCenter to Plone 4. limi and zenwryly replaced images of \"showcased sites\" in PloneServicesCenter with a web screenshot service to eliminate the need for storing images. (This move is still in progress, and various folks are working on issues with the web screenshot service. Please be patient!) zenwryly and limi moved content from plone.net to plone.org. aclark (remotely) pulled the DNS trigger on plone.net (re-configured A records for plone.net, to resolve to the same IP as plone.org) eleddy and spanktar created and released cioppino.twothumbs to facilitate \"thumb style\" (up/down) ratings in PloneSoftwareCenter. davisagli made it so Plone can start without PIL (via fixes to PlonePAS and plone.app.blob). And these fixes even made it in to Plone 4.1a3! To be clear, Plone still requires PIL to render images but it will start if it's missing. davisagli and eleddy refactored the PloneOrg buildout Bill and limi moved the remaining old Plone installers from Sourceforge to dist.plone.org . Post-sprint sprinting One of the great things about a sprint is that it really focuses attendees on accomplishing their tasks, long after they have left the event. To that end: aclark triaged the remaining tickets in the plone.org tracker, and did a final tally of closed ticket rankings: davisagli (55), aclark (32), eleddy (28), limi (7). davisagli wins! :-) aclark got inspired to begin uploading the half dozen or so missing videos from various Plone Conference 2008 talks (which were finally sent to him by the video company circa last year). Look for these to land on plone.org soon. eleddy continued to develop the \"two thumbs\" feature. eleddy and aclark deployed the \"two thumbs\" feature to plone.org. (This feature may not work as expected yet, eleddy is resolving issues.) Check it out: limi continued to improve the documentation/ and support/ sections of plone.org. Here are some screenshots of how the new sections will look once they launch: That's it! Just so you don't worry the sprinters worked too hard, you can rest assured everyone was in good hands with zenwryly and his travelling-bar. If you enjoyed reading this report and/or appreciate all the fun-but-hard work that goes in to attending a sprint, please consider donating to my travel fund . Only three days left, and I'm still a few dollars short!","tags":"Blog","title":"Cioppino Sprint Report"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/01/31/in-defense-of-pypi/","text":"Everyone on the Python Planet is probably already familiar with Peter Fein's recent article about PyPI use (or lack thereof). But in case not, particularly striking was the number of folks who joined the \"PyPI bashing\" in the comments. In fact, it has inspired me to write this post \"in defense of PyPI\". I would like to offer the Python community a summary of what I think are the general criticisms, along with my responses as a \"sysadmin / developer type\". First let me say this: I love PyPI! And I agree with Peter, if your package isn't on PyPI it \"doesn't exist\". I wouldn't put it quite like that; but I would say it's fairly important if you are publishing open source Python code, to consider uploading it to the Python Package Index. Why? Because Everybody Wins Believe it or not, the general Python community is interested in seeing your code. Whether to use it for an example, or to avoid reinventing the wheel, or whatever the reason; we'd like a chance to see your code. But if you don't publish it to PyPI, we may never get that chance! For better or worse, PyPI is the canonical place on Earth for Python packages. It's the CPAN of Python. I understand that not everyone is 100% comfortable with this, but that doesn't make it any less true. If you accept that \"open source is good\", and that \"Python rules\", then you simply must take this next leap of faith: \"PyPI is the place for Python packages\". [waves hand] Moving on, why else should you consider uploading your packages to PyPI? Because It Is The \"Right\" Thing To Do Another thing that struck me is the number of folks who (appear to) confuse \"version control\" with \"distribution\". If I'm not mistaken, Launchpad, Github, and Bitbucket are primarily designed for Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial hosting respectively. These sites can host your distribution tarballs, but they certainly weren't designed and built to do so. Rather, they were designed and built to host your source code. In some cases, a project may wish to host it's own distribution server . Whether it be for redundancy (although PyPI has begun to tackle this) or \"branding\" or other reasons, I would argue this is the preferred way of handling it: in addition to uploading to PyPI, not in place of it . Why? Because It Is Not That Hard Ahem… we get it. The situation with easy_install is \"less than ideal\". But this is something to be fixed, not avoided. If you are receiving too many support requests, may I suggest simply telling people not to use easy_install . Or, if the problem is proper packaging, learn how to test your packages before uploading them. Due to the large number of screwed up releases I've made, I've come to rely on a local PyPI and a virtualenv to test installations. Others use even simpler methods . And with tools like mkrelease, it's easy to upload your package to multiple PyPI locations with just a single command (although leaping-tall-buildings-in-a single-bound is not yet supported.) The point is, please consider helping the community fix the problem rather than simply avoiding it. There are folks actively trying to improve the situation right now. Let's see, what else? Because It Does Not Have To Be Perfect Over the years I've seen various and sundry criticisms of the PyPI user interface. Fine. I have not looked into the current development process, but I assume the author/maintainers would be open to some constructive criticism and/or development assistance. It doesn't have to be Github-sexy to be useful. If you would like to report a bug or feature request, do it here (at least, I think that is the right place.) Conclusion I hope this convinces at least some folks to consider uploading their packages to PyPI. If it doesn't, please let me know why in the comments. Did you enjoy reading this article? If so, please consider `helping me help Plone`_.","tags":"Blog","title":"In Defense of PyPI"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2011/01/26/hostout-rules/","text":"As in \"dominates\", not a \"list of rules\" :-) I spent a long time avoiding collective.hostout for reasons I will call \"technical stylistic differences\" with the author Dylan Jay. But then I grew up (and in cases of Plone growth like this, I usually end up crediting the probably-much-younger-than-me-in-years, but-certainly-much-more-possessive-of-sage-like-wisdom-than-me-Martin-Aspeli; and this time is certainly no exception. So thanks Martin!) As it turns out, Hostout (as I like to call it now, because we are on a first name basis) is awesome! Let me break down the awesomeness for you. Buildout It starts with Buildout. I won't bore you with the details of why Buildout is awesome, but I will mention one key feature: INI-style configuration, y'all. Sometimes you just want to specify something like: [foo] bar = baz and be done. I am not making this up folks. There is something about INI-style configuration that transcends time and space, and reaches across partisan-aisles to bring folks together in a \"let's just get this done\" sort of way. Of course not everyone likes them, but if you are a technical person and don't like them, I guarantee you at least understand them and can see why they might be appropriate in some cases over another technology. Anyway, back to the awesomeness. Fabric Fabric is awesome! I won't bore you with the details of why Fabric is awesome. But I will mention one key feature: SSH, people. SSH. Sometimes you just want to type: $ fab -H foo.com bar and be done. Fabric lets you execute the Python code you wrote in a function called \"bar\", inside a (local) file called fabfile.py, on a (remote) host called foo.com. All with the touch of a button, so to speak. That is to say, you create a local fabfile.py file, and Fabric runs the code remotely for you on any number of hosts you give it. Brilliant. Now, what could be better than these two technologies? These two technologies together , that's what. (See where I am going with this?) And what could be better than joining these two technologies? Joining them with absolutely no effort required on your part whatsoever , that's what. I have a long history of touting software that makes my job (and life) easier, and Hostout fits right in with that tradition. I'm just sorry it took me this long to try it out. Hostout As compelling as it is to write \"pure Python\" in fab files, and it is, sometimes you just want to be done. And Hostout helps you get there. I will explain in a minute, but first a slight detour. Back story I recently blogged about the relaunch of this website here . Shortly after the launch, I realized I needed a quick and easy way to deploy my staging site to production. I pitched the idea of a utility called \"mr.pusher\" to accomplish this task to Dylan, with the caveat that I was interested in making it work with Hostout. As it turns out, between Hostout and a recipe I created years ago called collective.recipe.rsync , \"mr.pusher\" almost already existed. Now back to the story. Fabric integration made easy Since I knew I wanted to be able to execute a \"push\" command remotely, I figured I would finally get acclimated with Hostout. After a small wrestling match in my head with the docs, I came up with this : # Hostout makes Fabric integration easy [staging] recipe = collective.hostout host = aclark.net path = /srv/staging[production] recipe = collective.hostout host = aclark.net path = /srv/aclark_net_website At this point (after running buildout) I was able to perform such great feats of remote administration (on my already-deployed-sans-hostout sites) as: $ bin/hostout staging run git pull $ bin/hostout staging run bin/buildout -c staging.cfg Armed with this ability, I added the following to my staging.cfg: # Create scripts to deploy staging data to production. # Be VERY careful with this. You could easily overwrite your # live production data if you either forget to use the script # option, or accidentally run the bin/rsync-filestorage-to-production # script without stopping the production site first. [filestorage-to-production] recipe = collective.recipe.rsync source = var/filestorage/Data.fs target = ../aclark_net_website/var/filestorage/Data.fs script = true[blobstorage-to-production] recipe = collective.recipe.rsync source = var/blobstorage/ target = ../aclark_net_website/var/blobstorage/ script = true The result was two scripts I could use to \"push\" staging to production, but only after stopping the production site first: $ bin/hostout production run bin/supervisorctl shutdown $ bin/hostout staging run bin/rsync-filestorage-to-production $ bin/hostout staging run bin/rsync-blobstorage-to-production $ bin/hostout production run bin/supervisord And we're deployed! This technique is particularly elegant when used in combination with a custom 503 . Conclusion I really like this setup, and I really appreciate what Hostout gets me \"for free\"; I didn't have to create a fabfile.py, I just configured my staging and production host parameters in buildout.cfg and off I went. Of course, there is always room for improvement. The next most logical step for me would be to add cloud integration. If I could provision a new Rackspace cloud server via buildout, and then host-it-out, I think the future will have arrived. And since that is exactly what hostout.cloud appears to do, welcome to the future! Alex Clark (January 2011) Did you enjoy reading this article?

Better late than never. I get bored with the same ol' blog entry titles: \"A review of so and so's book, by such and such…\" Not that there is anything wrong with these titles, they serve their purpose. It's not you… it's me. Can we still be friends? Anyway, I will cut to the chase with this one: if you care about Plone and you have not done so already, you should buy `Plone 3 for Education`_ right now. Why? Several reasons: Erik Rose cares about Plone. He cares so much, he spent months of his life pouring his professional experiences into a book so you can benefit! PACKT publishing will donate a percentage of the proceeds to the Plone Foundation. You will learn a lot about Plone, from the perspective of someone who has supported its deployment and maintenance within a large educational institution. That is not to say every Plone book is for you. You have to decide for yourself if you want this beautiful creation (see above) of Erik's to shine on your mantle piece for years to come. Even if you are a giant Plone supporter, and even if you make your living off of Plone, you may still not want to purchase this book. That's just the way that it goes. But, I will to try to convince you anyway! Here is my chapter-by-chapter review: Preface The preface sets the tone of the book, and I like the tone Erik sets. Erik has used Plone for many years at Penn State and you will find his experiences valuable. He's made mistakes so you don't have to! Chapter 1 Chapter 1 covers creating courses (of course!) Erik makes the argument that Plone can hold it's own against expensive course management software, and I believe him. Of particular interest are Erik's recommendations to: Put courses in large Plone folders Use news items, events and collections in the context of a course. Cut and paste the course framework once you are done creating it. Chapter 2 Chapter 2 introduces calendaring in Plone, and Erik suggests using Plone4artists calendar to make your course content easily browsable. Of particular interest are Erik's recommendations to: Replace the stock Plone events folder (which is a collection contained within a folder) with (just) a collection. Make clever use of keywords to support lots of events. Reorder subfolders in a collection \"the hard way\". (Also interesting that he opened this ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9109 and that it has received no \"love\" to date. Perhaps the new collections UI: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10902 will save the day!) Chapter 3 Chapter 3 showcases the Faculty/Staff Directory (FSD) add-on for Plone which allows you to create an online personnel directory. Of particular interest is Erik's explanation of how to categorize and correlate people within FSD. Chapter 4 Chapter 4 covers customizing Faculty/Staff Directory. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of AT Schema Extender (which is a great way to customize Plone these days). Chapter 5 Chapter 5 covers blogs and forums. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of Scrawl , and the need to exercise extreme caution when installing add-ons (always good advice). Chapter 6 Chapter 6 covers audio and video. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of collective.flowplayer which makes Flowplayer easy to use in Plone. Chapter 7 Chapter 7 covers forms. Of particular interest is Erik's comparison of PloneFormGen to Archetypes content objects, and his explanation of when to use one over the other. Chapter 8 Chapter 8 covers theming. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of \"new style\" template customizations via z3c.jbot (which you don't even need a package for! ) Chapter 9 Chapter 9 covers deployment. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of a typical production software stack that includes ZEO, Zope2, Apache and of course Plone. Also covered is CacheFu, which has been superseded by plone.app.caching in Plone 4. Chapter 10 Chapter 10 covers maintenance. Of particular interest is Erik's coverage of collective.recipe.backup to automate the creation of repozo scripts. I would add to that, you can use z3c.recipe.usercrontab to automate the creation and removal of cron jobs to execute those scripts. Conclusion All in all, I enjoyed reading this book. And, I appreciate whenever a member of the community shares his/her experiences. So thank you, Erik! That's it! I hope you will consider purchasing a copy of Plone 3 for Education right now.

And that is by no means for lack of desire. I fantasize about spending a year attending every Plone (and Python) related event on the planet, but I've got a ways to go before I can make that dream a reality. In the meantime, I'm excited to announce that the stars have aligned in February 2011 and I am planning to attend the Cioppino sprint AKA West Coast \"Snow\" Sprint (plane tickets purchased!) But, I really need everyone's help to make this trip a success. While I would love to be able to afford it, our financial stars have not aligned for February 2011 and I will be seeking donations in order to offset the cost of travel and lodging. I'll be spending (at least) two full days working on Plone-related tasks, for whatever you can guestimate that may be worth (in a consulting context.) And in addition to helping out however I can with the scheduled tasks , I have a long list of admin tasks I would like to try and tackle: http://admin-docs.plone.org/todo.html Why you should donate Time I donate to the Plone project is a labor of love, but there are \"real world\" implications. If you have enjoyed, or otherwise benefited from any of the following, I would appreciate your generous contribution right now; very, very much! Plone.org website maintenance : I spend a lot of time wrangling troops and performing feats of great maintenance on plone.org: http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.org/Products.PloneOrg/trunk/ Plone.org systems maintenance : I consider myself a provider of great services for a great community. I've made a very significant effort to try and improve the services that volunteers are able to provide for such a great community. In documentation, and in deed I plan to keep doing this for at least all of 2011: http://admin-docs.plone.org . Plone software technical support : I spend a great deal of time trying to de-mystify Plone technology for the masses. Early adoption is part of this process. I like to see Plone moving forward and I like to see others embracing that move: http://blog.aclark.net/2011/01/19/new-website-for-2011/ And much, much more! I try to do as much for Plone as I can because it does a lot for me. I've organized a conference and written a book and I expect to be active in the community for at least the rest of 2011, and most likely4life. How much should you donate I am trying to raise $1,000 USD to cover the following: Plane tickets : approximately $400 USD. Housing : approximately $400 USD. Food and miscellaneous travel expenses : approximately $200 USD. I would appreciate any amount you can afford to give, to help-me-help-Plone be as great as it can be!

It took approximately one month to complete; and we are proud to present it to the world today! We are particularly proud that this website can serve a dual-purpose: to make us look good, and to serve as an example of how easy and fun it is to install and use Plone. Look ma, no package! One of the requirements I had in developing a new website was that I would ditch my old Products.aclark_net package in favor of… nothing. (Sort of.) What I mean is, the entire website was developed and deployed within a single, small buildout: https://github.com/aclark4life/aclark_net_website . The buildout is meant to be instructional (!) so if you have questions, please ask them in the comments. [buildout] # Extends import buildout config files from elsewhere extends = # http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/buildout.cfg http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/zeo.cfg http://good-py.appspot.com/release/collective.xdv/1.0# Parts define what this buildout does parts += trac xdv staging production blog[plone] # Eggs are Python packages eggs += # \"New style\" theming in Plone collective.xdv # \"New style\" template overrides z3c.jbot# Plone is a modern web application that uses the Zope Toolkit # internally to provide complex functionality in a manageable way. # # The Zope Toolkit features the Zope component architecure; and # components are configured via the Zope Configuration Markup Language (ZCML). # # Rather than create a Python package to do simple customizations, we add # our ZCML here and the plone.recipe.zope2instance will add it to our # Zope 2 instance configuration file(s) for us whenever we run bin/buildout. zcml-additional = # Add static resource dir <configure xmlns:browser=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/browser\" > <browser:resourceDirectory name=\"static\" directory=\"${buildout:directory}/static\" /> # Add custom templates dir <include package=\"z3c.jbot\" file=\"meta.zcml\" /> <browser:jbot directory=\"${buildout:directory}/templates\" /> </configure>[blog] # Compile the blog theme recipe = plone.recipe.command command = bin/xdvcompiler -r theme/rules/blog.xml -t theme/templates/blog.html -o theme/blog.xsl update-command = ${:command}[trac] # Compile the trac theme recipe = plone.recipe.command command = bin/xdvcompiler -r theme/rules/trac.xml -t theme/templates/trac.html -o theme/trac.xsl update-command = ${:command}# This creates bin/xdvcompiler [xdv] recipe = zc.recipe.egg# Hostout makes Fabric integration easy [staging] recipe = collective.hostout host = aclark.net path = /srv/staging[production] recipe = collective.hostout host = aclark.net path = /srv/aclark_net_website[versions] plone.registry = 1.0b4 plone.app.registry = 1.0b5 Diazo For the first time ever, I decided to try deploying Diazo (formerly XDV) within Plone itself. That meant installing collective.xdv in Plone and pointing it to a rules.xml file. This only works for Plone, though. Wordpress and Trac are still themed outside Plone, by compiling their themes with xdvcompiler and pointing Apache to the resulting .xsl files. Content I am obsessive about content. I am also obsessive about simplicity. And in today's world of need-it-now , I have become conditioned to \"do\" now and ask questions later (which is not always recommended, by the way). That meant that for this website, rather than migrate content (which in some cases was contained in custom fields added by Archetypes schema extender) I opted to setup a \"clean\" Plone and copy/paste/edit content. On a small site like ours, this was a no-brainer for me. But it definitely exposes a weakness of Plone. Now that theming has improved, we really need a better \"content story\". To me, that is starting to mean focusing on satisfying a \"simple\" use case like exporting and importing content in Plone. There are folks working on this of course, it just needs to advance to the point where we can offer it in the Plone core IMHO. Todo Of course there is always more to do. The first thing that jumps out that is missing from this deployment is \"cool (Javascript) overlays\" or \"pop-ups,\" depending on who you ask. I didn't have time to add them prior to launch, but I will most likely add them later because I can . A couple more Plone-core related features I would love to see implemented (technically, Diazo is not in the core yet): I want to add GenericSetup (GS) profiles outside Python packages (i.e. in the buildout via ZCML). Currently GenericSetup expects to be passed a context which is (I think) the old-style Zope 2 product object in the ZODB. But I can't think of a reason why GS couldn't be made to work sans that requirement (I'm just speculating though, I haven't looked at the code yet). I wish Diazo (collective.xdv) could be configured via GenericSetup. I'd like to configure the path to the rules.xml file in something like profiles/default/diazo.xml such that when a Plone site is created and the Diazo import step is run, the path to the rules file is set automatically. Conclusion This is certainly one of the most fun times I've head developing a Plone website (which is nice when you are in the Plone website business). I attribute that directly to all of the awesome folks involved in the project. I can't list everyone here, but I will \"shout out\" to some of the folks who I think were instrumental in getting us here: Eric Steele & the entire Plone 4 framework team, for their work on Plone 4. Hanno Schlichting for making Plone fast again. Martin Aspeli and Laurence Rowe for Diazo. And David Glick, for being \"always on\" (and my own personal devil's advocate). And really, everyone involved in the Plone project on a day to day basis. Plone development and consulting can be frustrating at times, but more often than not it is a magical experience, due in no small part due to the seemingly never-ending supply of cool and dedicated folks. A look back Also, I've been doing this long enough now that it's now very entertaining (to me at least) to look back at the various incarnations of the ACLARK.NET, LLC website over the years (these are guestimates): Circa 2006: Plone 2.5 with a Cereblue skin I purchased for $50 :-) Circa 2007: Plone 3.0 with a custom \"old style\" theme that I designed (and I'm not a designer). Circa 2008: Plone 3.3 with XDV (now Diazo) plus \"open source\" theme. Circa 2011: Plone 4 with collective.xdv, z3c.jbot, and \"open source\" buildout and theme, and nothing else. To the future Onwards Plone team! Here is to 2011.","tags":"Blog","title":"New website for 2011!"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2010/11/04/a-report-on-plonetheme/","text":"By now, most of us are familiar with XDV and how awesome it is for theming Plone (or any website). You should also be aware that XDV has been renamed to Diazo , and collective.xdv is now called plone.app.theming . But let us not forget the humble \"old style\" theme just yet! Sometimes they come in very handy, and may even be preferable in some cases depending on what you are trying to accomplish. I just gave plonetheme .* a quick spin and thought I'd share the process and results with anyone that might find it useful. Step 1 Get a list of all the plonetheme packages on PyPI: $ pip search plonetheme Step 2 Create a buildout: $ virtualenv plone-theme-test $ bin/easy_install zc.buildout $ bin/buildout init Step 3 Edit your buildout.cfg to include the following: [buildout] extends = http://dist.aclark.net/buildout/plone/4.0.x/buildout.cfg parts = plone[plone] eggs += ${theme:eggs}zcml += ${theme:eggs}[theme] eggs =# Deps that the themes should have added collective.contentleadimage collective.flowplayer z3c.jbot# Products.categorynavigator # # XXX Products.categorynavigator is a dep of plonetheme.mvob but it # has a NameError # ZopeXMLConfigurationError: File \"/Users/aclark/Developer/packages… # NameError: name 'ImportException' is not defined# themes plonetheme.notredame plonetheme.fui plonetheme.sunburst plonetheme.colorcontext plonetheme.twinapex # plonetheme.mvob plonetheme.peerstheme plonetheme.nautica05 plonetheme.stylized plonetheme.labs plonetheme.sait2009 plonetheme.cultureCab plonetheme.xtheme plonetheme.mimbo plonetheme.python plonetheme.terrafirma plonetheme.solemnity plonetheme.level2 plonetheme.tidyblog plonetheme.andreas01 plonetheme.blueblog plonetheme.delicious2 # plonetheme.hamnavoe plonetheme.greencommunity plonetheme.subordinate plonetheme.bluegray plonetheme.p2 plonetheme.aclark_twitter plonetheme.relic plonetheme.classic # plonetheme.simplicity plonetheme.netsightintranet plonetheme.keepitsimple plonetheme.andreas02 plonetheme.essay plonetheme.ReOrg # plonetheme.Bangalore plonetheme.nonzero plonetheme.cleantheme plonetheme.minimalist plonetheme.inbusiness # plonetheme.corporatemale plonetheme.portaltwodotoh plonetheme.rcom plonetheme.equipoteih plonetheme.pyar plonetheme.basic# XXX plonetheme.GreenEarthTheme3_0 has zope.configuration.config… # error # plonetheme.GreenEarthTheme3_0 #zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationExecutionError: <type … # in: # File \"/Users/aclark/Developer/packages/plonetheme.GreenEarthTheme… # <cmf:registerDirectory # name=\"GreenEarthTheme3_0_templates\"/> plonetheme.criticas plonetheme.gemstone # plonetheme.bronzecube plonetheme.lithium plonetheme.overlappedtabs Step 4 Run buildout; start Plone; play around! Conclusion The whole effort (including writing the blog post) took only an hour or two, for whatever that is worth (not including the actual theme review, unfortunately!). I find the results interesting and I thought you might too. Process Dependencies You'll notice in the [theme] section, comments about various packages that were not included with all of the various themes. As far as I can tell, it is in the best interest of \"old style\" theme developers to specify these packages in their setup.py files with the install_requires parameter! OK, it's actually in my best interest because then I have to do less work, but you get the idea. Broken or missing packages The plonetheme .* packages that are just commented out (without an XXX note) did not make it past the bin/buildout step (for whatever reason, usually a broken package). Themes My favorite theme (right after plonetheme.aclark_twitter, that is) is… nevermind! I wanted to report on that but I still have to go through all the themes! (By installing each one at a time, testing, then uninstalling before moving to the next one.) Packaging Just my opinion, but if you are adding functionality to Plone, it's probably not (just) a theme. So I would separate that functionality from your plonetheme .* code. Problems jbot modifies default Plone theme? I've noticed this before in both Plone Classic and now Sunburst when jbot is installed. No idea what the actual cause is: Disclaimer Designed for Plone 4? Before you say it (I know you are thinking it), I know not all of these themes are designed to work with Plone 4. I dont' have a good answer about how to approach that problem (I just know that when looking for themes, I don't really care. I just \"want it to work\".) Bug report please? I know, I know. I should open a ticket for the jbot thing. And now off to play! P.S. I will report on the install process in the comments. So far, Andreas installed, worked, and looked nice while Bluegray Theme 1.0.0b2 required a ZMI undo ;-)","tags":"Blog","title":"A report on plonetheme.*"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2010/10/15/i-reinstalled-recently/","text":"And for whatever it is worth to anyone, here are the notes I took (for the first time ever, when doing a reinstall): o System Preferences -> Organize alphabeticallyo Sync bluetooth mouseo Software update * 2 - Reboot * 2o Install XCodeo Customize Dock - Add Terminal - Remove Mail, Photo Booth, Address Booko Restore apps (from Time Capsule) - Skype - Firefox - Set home page - View -> Toolbars -> Customize -> Use small Icons - Preferences -> Privacy -> History -> Use custom settings for history -> Uncheck all but 'remember my browsing history' and 'Accept cookies from sites' - Preferences -> Security -> Passwords -> Uncheck remember passwords for sites - Set persona (I'd probably like these to rotate) - Preferences -> General -> Downloads -> Show the Downloads window when download a file -> Close it when all downloads are finished - Preferences -> General -> Downloads -> Save files to -> Desktop - Cisco VPN client - Real VNC - VLC - Textmate (sometimes handy even though i use vi) - Parallels - Ubuntu & Windows 7 VMs - Handbrake - MacTheRipper - Cord - MS Office 2004 - iWorko svn co https://my-dot-fileso Switch shell to zsh (biggest win?

The Apache modules for XDV presented themselves as an attractive technique to use, in helping me achieve my goals. Background Previously, I had been blissfully running http://aclark.net with NGINX, Plone 4 trunk, and XDV on a small virtual machine and absolutely loving it. Additionally, I had separate virtual machines for my Wordpress blog (blog.aclark.net) and Subversion software repository (svn.aclark.net). The isolation of these services made them easy to manage and still relatively cheap to run them all. And in fact, I have come to rely heavily on the ability to (1.) rapidly create a virtual machine, (2.) install a bunch of vendor packages that Just Work™, and (3.) build out whatever was left i.e. whatever could not be easily installed via OS vendor packages. This usually translates loosely into \"I use Buildout for my Plone sites, and an OS vendor package installer for everything else\". That said, even though I already knew the hazards of trying to cram too many services on to a single \"shared\" host, and didn't really want to do that dance again, it seemed reasonable at the time to at least try and consolidate them on to a single virtual machine (it sounds crazy in hindsight). First choice: NGINX Like I said earlier, the forked version of NGINX available on the HTML-XSLT website is an absolute pleasure to use. But when I pondered consolidating services I knew it would not be easy, and maybe even impossible to run Wordpress behind NGINX. Second choice: Apache So I thought to myself, \"I know, I'll just switch to the Apache modules for XDV\" and that will solve my PHP/Plone \"integration\" problems for the time being. (Another way to solve them would be to use the XDV middleware along with Zope 2.13 's WSGI support; I will be trying that next.) But not so fast. Problems Of course, things don't always go as planned. First problem The Apache modules for XDV do not work exactly \"as advertised\" on any of the \"modern\" OS platforms I tried (Debian, various Ubuntus, and Arch Linux). They compile fine against the operating system's Apache, but do not run properly. See this thread on the Deliverance mailing list (and I challenge anyone reading this to correct me! :-D) \"Fine,\" I thought, I'll just create a buildout to deploy everything. I wrote a book about deploying Plone websites with Buildout. This should be easy, right? Wrong. Second problem It's hard to create such a buildout for a variety of reasons, but most noticeably in my mind is the \"library soup\" you may encounter on any modern system. For example, I started off by trying to include all the dependencies in the buildout. But I ended up leaving things out, like libxml2 and libxslt relying instead on the operating system vendor packages. Because even though I tried desperately to tell every other dependency about the included libxml2 and libxslt2, I still ended up with an annoying \"missing symbols\" error at the end (meaning I likely missed a compiler flag along the way). These errors can be very frustrating, and even worse: sporadic . Sometimes you may inadvertently add or remove a system dependency during the build process. So you could be relying on a system package and not even know it until later when it is too late (i.e. when you are enjoying some unplanned and unexpected down time). So there I went again. It took several days I didn't really have, and the results were not what I expected, but I'm still somewhat happy with them. Now, I want to share this buildout particularly with folks considering using the Apache modules for XDV ( http://code.google.com/p/html-xslt/ ). Because while it would be much easier if the Apache modules Just Worked™ with OS vendor packages, in the event that they don't (which is what I experienced) folks may find this buildout helpful. (That, and Jon Stahl requested it on Facebook :-D). Conclusion Anyway, I'm quite happy with the buildout and I am sharing it in hopes that it will move the Apache/XDV story forward. In addition to compiling Apache with mod_depends and mod_transform, it includes Subversion, Trac, mod_wsgi, PHP and Wordpress. As I mentioned earlier, it is not really my preference to cram all this stuff in to one buildout, but as long as it is reliable and consistent, I don't mind it too much. It also handles the theme compilation for a variety of services, which is accomplished via a command recipe that executes calls to bin/xdvcompiler . Incidentally, I have no particular allegiance to, or dislike of Apache: more like a love/hate relationship; it can be very useful in a variety of situations, while at the same time confounding. But regardless, I would like to see the Apache XDV modules be able to deliver the same rock solid performance as the NGINX fork. Kudos to Laurence Rowe (et al.) for the Apache modules! I hope this blog entry will facilitate a push to get people using them with their operating system vendor's Apache packages , which may inspire Laurence to continue developing them, and most importantly to fix bugs ;-). Normally, I like to factor out the reusable bits first, but this buildout is presented in it's entirety as I am using it (minus some customer bits), for whatever that is worth.

But certainly sweat and tears! If Plone Conference 2006 was my inspiration for Plone Conference 2008 , then Professional Plone Development was my inspiration for this book: Plone 3.3 Site Administration . For the past 14 months or so, I have been writing a book aimed at end users of Plone; folks that have little knowledge of how to do much more than add content. It is intended to make them feel more comfortable performing various site administrator tasks. Topics like theming, maintenance, and optimization are covered. But wait, there's more! #1 This book aims to \"lower the Plone bar for users of Python\". What do I mean by that? Basically this: I love Python almost as much as I love Plone. It lets me translate my thoughts directly into code. I fantasize that with little more than a Python interpreter, one can forge a working Plone site within minutes. But it is not just a fantasy, it is (more or less) the status quo. (Maybe even MacGyver used Python?) So, this book begins at the beginning: by making sure folks are comfortable installing and using Python on there operating system of choice (or using the pre-installed Python). If you read Professional Plone Development , you may recall Martin Aspeli saying at the beginning of Chapter 3: We will assume that Python 2.4 gets invoked when you run python on the command line. This book does not make that assumption and tries to cover everything you may need to know after installing your operating system up to that point. In Chapter 1 , we cover installing and running Python on three popular operating systems: Mac OS X 10.6 (my main squeeze), Windows 7, and Ubuntu 9.10 (Debian is my main production server squeeze). Other operating systems are welcome; your mileage may vary. #2 This book is largely a response to the whole \"Oh no! I have to use Buildout to install Plone and its add-ons!\" sentiment that has been prevalent since Buildout was first introduced to Plone several years ago. I don't know if Buildout was the \"right\" way to go, but I do know that I love using it and I would like to help others feel the same way. The bottom line is this: Plone made a conscious decision to \"become more Pythonic\" by using eggs. With that choice came more complexity from potential conflicts between eggs. Buildout is one solution to that problem. Unfortunately, it introduces other problems like cryptic error messages and a certain too-many-moving-parts -ness. An aside… Let me correct myself: I am fairly certain Buildout was the right way to go at the time. What I am not sure about is where to go from here. It would be nice to get back to a place where folks could just drop packages in to a directory (I don't literally mean going back to old-style products, but perhaps we could provide that type of functionality again somehow). But I don't have an answer for that. In the meantime, let's make everyone more comfortable with using Buildout. About the rest of the book… The book teaches you to find your way around Buildout and Plone. Whether you choose to follow along and build your site from scratch using only Buildout (and a paper clip) or if you use one of the Buildout-based installers (like the Unified Installer), this book aims to make you more competent and comfortable performing a variety of Buildout-related tasks. In Chapters 2-7 , we present various buildout configuration files that correspond to specific tasks that are related to various subjects, e.g. theming, maintenance, and optimization. The reader is expected to \"know how to write a buildout.cfg file\" by the end. No one that reads the book is allowed in the #plone IRC channel afterward to ask about buildout (you can answer buildout questions though). Kidding… I kid… In the final Chapter 8 , we cover new technologies like XDV and repoze.zope2 which may become more mainstream once you decide to start using them (although the latter seems more like a toy to keep us busy until the real fix arrives: full WSGI support in Zope 2 ). When will it arrive? PACKT originally announced the book will arrive in March and I have been working non-stop since mid-March to make sure it gets out the door as quickly as possible; I expect it to be available Real Soon Now™ . I apologize to those of you who have pre-ordered and are now waiting for it! So get ready! I plan to have over 200 pages of draft material submitted by the end of this month. I will continue to work with PACKT to address any concerns that arise during editing. They have promised to try to ship the book by May, so we will see how it goes. I encourage you to pre-order now as that will go a long way to inspire them to work just that much harder to get it done and out to you, ASAP! Can I write a book? Probably. For those curious about the process (as I very much was), here is a bit about how it went for me: A few years ago, Martin Aspeli had the idea for Practical Plone 3 and put out a call to writers that I responded to; I ended up contributing 2 chapters. This taught me that it was indeed a lot of work, and I got exposed to the editing process. A couple years ago, PACKT approached me (and several others) about the idea for Plone Site Administration and I thought I had a good story to tell based on my experiences, so I wrote a detailed outline and they accepted it. Though I had written for Practical Plone 3, I struggled to find my voice. At the same time I had a tremendous amount of consulting work to do to make a living. I sneaked in time to write drafts and eventually found my voice. To be honest, the most productive work has been done in the last 3 months. Perhaps the biggest lesson I learned was this: stop thinking and start writing. I tend to over analyze things and spent a lot of time thinking about \"how it would go\" rather than just writing it. Writing is the key. Think less, write more (at which point your thoughts tends to flow more naturally anyway). Should I write a book? Possibly. I am sensitive to the phenomenon of \"Plone book diarrhea\" and I do think that there can be such a thing as too many Plone books. But I don't think we are there yet. To me, the more books published about Plone (by PACKT or any publisher) the better. I like to see what each individual author brings to the story, even if the stories they are telling tend to overlap sometimes. So for me the answer to that question both before and after writing my book is yes . I know I am a better writer having written it, and I certainly know more about Python, Zope, and Plone and many other technologies. In either case, you should definitely take my class. If you are interested in learning more about Python and tools like Distribute, Pip, Buildout, etc. and you want to feel more comfortable managing your Plone site, you will not want to miss the one day class I am teaching at Plone Symposium East 2010 ! The book will hopefully be out by then, but the class will go on either way. Hope to see you there, and I hope you enjoy the book. P.S. Looking for Plone experts? Hire ACLARK.NET, LLC. Thank you, everyone, for the responses to my previous blog entry . I have had some great conversations with some very interesting folks and I appreciate everyone's interest. However, I wanted to encourage everyone once more to get in touch. And also, to feel free to reach whenever you come across this blog entry and are in need of Plone help. We are always looking for a challenge.","tags":"Blog","title":"Blood, sweat, tears… and a new Plone book!"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2010/03/22/i-need-something-to-do/","text":"I would like to think I have done my share for Plone over the past few years. In return, I know that Plone has done its share for me. I have learned a lot, made a good living, and met a lot of amazing folks who have really inspired me to be the best I can be. But it is time for a change. If my life were the movie Forrest Gump , this would be the part where Forrest stops running, stands in the highway for a minute… then turns around and goes home to Greenbow Alabama (which as it turns out is a fictional town, who knew?) *(Apparently this person had the same epiphany!)* Not a drastic change mind you, just a re-focus. To that end, I would like to reach out to the community I know and love (Plone!) and see if anyone has anything for me to do. Please contact me if you are interested, and please tell all your friends too! You never know who knows who and who is looking for what. Let me tell you a little bit about what I have done professionally and what I would like to do now, followed by some requirements I hope can be met. What I have done: I received a Computer Science degree in May 1998 after about 10 years of undergrad education (transferred, changed majors, etc.) - I've done a lot of system administration and network engineering , mostly for ISPs including AOLnet (back in the day). I have done a lot of Plone . I started doing Plone at my last full-time system administrator job, and became so obsessed with it that I had to quit to pursue it full time , mostly thanks to the support of my wife Amy, and Paul Boos and Nate Aune who handed me my first contracts! I have organized monthly meetings for ZPUGDC for the last 4 years or so, taking over for Joel Burton when he moved to California. We are now in the process of becoming a 501c3 so we can expand our focus and serve the community in bigger and better ways. ZPUGDC is not a full time job, but it as a passion (to be a resource for all things Python in DC). I have owned and operated ACLARK.NET, LLC for the past six years. All in all this has been an amazing experience and I have no plans to stop. We are now at the point where we can compete with all the \"big firms\" and we intend to do so. But I need time to answer some RFQs… I organized Plone Conference 2008 and wrote a book . I upgraded plone.org to Plone 3 , and now lead the plone.org infrastructure team member , taking over for Wichert Akkerman (more or less) when he left. This is something I particularly enjoy. No wait, I hate it. Just kidding. It is something I like, and plan to focus on it more in the future to make sure it gets done right. It is very frustrating to want to do something but not have time to do it. I'm sure all you Plone consultants know what I mean. I have done some Python programming and evangelism: I have paid particular attention to making ZPUGDC more Python-centric , by welcoming all Python programmers in the area not just Plonistas. This has worked out very well and our monthly attendance has gone from 5-6 to 15-20. Each month, we go around the room and talk about \"what we are doing with Python\". It is always interesting. I write code . I am particularly proud that working for myself has afforded me my first paid programming job (programming for system administration doesn't really count IMO). There is a ton to learn: Networking frameworks like Twisted, Web application frameworks like Zope, Django, Turbo Gears, Pylons, BFG, etc. Continuous integration with Hudson (OK, that is Java but you can use it on your Python code ;-)), Documentation with Sphinx. And so on. What I would like to do: Open Source Software : I really like open source software. It started in the mid 1990s when I realized that there was this thing called the Internet and that people had been writing code for years and making it available for general use to anyone interested. That just floored me. I can still remember the thrill of borrowing a UNIX text book from my professor the summer before I started CS classes. At the time, it seemed like UNIX and open source walked hand in hand and I became obsessed with both. I realize now there is much more to that story, but that is how the seeds were planted. Anyway, open source is for me and I am for open source. I am not sure what that means in terms of job opportunities, but maybe I could be an evangelist like Mark Hinkle, and evangelize Your Software like he evangelizes Zenoss. Just a thought. Plone, Python, Zope, Zenoss : I really like these open source projects, in particular. Any paid position that involves almost any aspect of these projects would make me happy. I have pimped myself out to Zenoss and I eventually expect to hang out my Zenoss shingle and start doing add-ons, customizations, etc. for Zenoss users. But I am not quite there yet. I know Plone, and can handle most development and deployment tasks. I am particularly interested in large-scale deployments (e.g. City of Austin type clients, only with a better outcome ;-)). Busy work . It sounds silly, but repetitive tasks fit my brain. Automating large scale deployments. Configuration management. System updates. These things I can do, and help you with too. Learn : If there is one thing I've learned after learning so much over the years, it is that I hardly know anything. I hope to be a part of team that offers a significant growth opportunity. It's time to raise the bar. What I require to work for you: Six month contract or longer . Whatever I sign on to do, it has to last six months or more (preferably until the end of 2010). This is the time frame I am particularly concerned about (for a variety of personal reasons). I can start April 1 or after. Repeat: it is definitely OK if it lasts longer than six months. Travel . I can travel almost anywhere in the world, as long as you pay for it ;-). But seriously, working from home is a requirement, but meetings (monthly? bi-monthly?) in your city should not be a problem. Fun and flexibility . I do Plone for a living because Plone is fun. I work very hard to make sure your needs are met, and I ask for a lot of flexibility in return. Deadlines are not a problem, but the ability to act independently to meet the deadline is. Paid Plone work . Ideally someone will hire me to do all the things I already love to do like maintaining plone.org, sprinting on various tasks, perhaps joining the Plone 4.1 Framework Team. Anything and everything I can do to make the Plone project better and stronger. This of course does not have to be the main focus of the work, but it would be nice if some time could be allocated officially towards these tasks. Part time . Ideally I'd like to put in about 20 hours per week on some project, and spend the other 20 hours on ACLARK.NET, ZPUGDC, INC. Above all, I am flexible. This post is about me, but I am certainly willing to listen to what you, prospective employer, has to offer. If there is a good fit, I am confident we can make it work. I look forward to hearing from you! Oh, I almost forgot, my updated resume is here: http://aclark.net/team/aclark/resume .

(And 1.0 sites too, for that matter. Just look for the tell-tale '/help' sign, e.g. http://www.zope.org/help , if you suspect Plone 1). I know, because I just deployed one (a cool artist's site if you have a couple hours to kill…). But I didn't do it the \"old way\" with Zope 2 instances created by hand on clunky physical servers, I used Buildout and the Cloud . Aside #1 As an aside: it was really bothering me lately that you couldn't (easily) find older Plone releases at SourceForge . This is by design to avoid confusion, but still confusing. So when I needed the most recent 2.1.x tarball I decided to scratch my itch and fix the \"problem\". I started gathering the hard to find releases and putting them here . OK… so I only gathered one release (2.1.4), but I swear I had good intentions. If you'd like to see any additional releases \"moved\" to dist.plone.org, please let me know in the comments. Aside #2 Another aside: I should mention here the advent of a tool that promises to simplify deployment of Python-based web applications to the cloud (or supported service, which technically does not have to be \"cloud-based\") via the use of APIs (in particular, the Rackspace Cloud API, which is the only one supported so far): Silver Lining ! The idea of using this tool got me so excited, I spent some time experimenting with setting up a new host with it (and purchasing their service). But when I realized it was not quite ready for production (i.e. \" if you want to use Silver Lining, Silver Lining is not for you \" :-)), I ended up using the Rackspace Cloud web interface . I was so impressed with it. I literally moved all of my (granted, relatively small number of client sites) to their service within a matter of 1-2 months. Now, I know what you are thinking, and I do intend to explore other services (in fact, I have tried Slicehost and it was OK), but this service made my life so much easier I wanted to mention some of its key features: \"On the fly\" requisitioning. You can add/remove hosts anytime and you only pay for the time they are up. \"On the fly\" resizing of hosts. In my testing and real world experience, the resizing (e.g. move from a host with 256MB RAM and 10GB disk to 500MB RAM and 20GB disk) was painless (literally only cost a few minutes of downtime). The potential for all of this to be done remotely via a command line tool like Silver Lining. Aside #3 A third and final aside: the status quo of WSGI support for Plone. Since Zope 2 is not supported by Silver Lining, the key to deploying Plone sites with it is currently to use repoze.zope2 . Nate Aune has recently made some progress with this, and more work is scheduled for Plone Symposium East . My latest swipe at WSGI-Plone is here: http://svn.aclark.net/svn/public/buildout/plone/branches/3.x-wsgi/ The actual point And finally, to the point of this blog entry! I have created a generic Plone 2.1 buildout for anyone interested. You can find it here: http://svn.aclark.net/svn/public/buildout/plone/branches/2.1.x/ . Using it is simple, as described in the README.txt : $ svn export http://svn.aclark.net/svn/public/buildout/plone/branches/2.1.x/ plone $ cd plone $ python2.4 bootstrap.py $ bin/buildout $ bin/instance fg Since Plone 2.1 community support has expired for this release, and since Plone 2.1 shipped with Python 2.3 (if I recall correctly), this is definitely \"unsupported use of Plone\". But when you need it, you need it. I have yet to experience any issues related to the Python version, for whatever that is worth (possibly due to the fact that Plone 2.1 originally shipped with Python 2.3 and Zope 2.7, then Zope 2.8 came along which worked with Python 2.4. Just a guess).","tags":"Blog","title":"Using Buildout to deploy a Plone 2.1 site to the cloud"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2010/01/12/just-friends-first-cutmov/","text":"[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dK-l41uRio&w=420&h=315 ] Just Friends ============ Copyright © Alex Clark 2010 (Capo 5) A (form) I just want to be friends with you A (form) I don't want to have to do","tags":"Blog","title":"just friends (first cut).mov"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2010/01/07/no-really-you-can-just-use-buildout-to-install-plone/","text":"This is a follow up to my Getting Excited about Plone as Eggs post, because I can't keep updating that one forever. Generally speaking, the recommended (and supported) way to install Plone is via the installers, e.g. the Unified Installer . Obviously, if you want things to Just Work™ you should be using the latest stable release, which is why I linked to the 3.3.3 unified installer (although there is no Windows installer for 3.3.3 yet, which is why it's not released on plone.org). That said, since both Plone and Zope 2 have been packaged as eggs (Plone became an egg in version 3.2 and Zope 2 became an egg as of Zope 2.12 which is the version of Zope 2 that Plone 4 will use) it has become \"mostly trivial\" to write a buildout.cfg to install Plone with. That means that you don't even need paster to do it. You can just fire up an editor and type: [buildout] parts = instance [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance user = admin:admin eggs = Plone Amazing! Of course there is the nasty bit about PIL, which I get around now-a-days by adding a very specific find-link, e.g.: [buildout] parts = instance find-links = http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/PILwoTk-1.1.6.4.tar.gz [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance user = admin:admin eggs = PILwoTk Plone What you should have at this point is a working Plone, but not necessarily a repeatable buildout. The reason being we have not pinned any egg versions yet, so we are effectively asking for whatever the latest version of Plone is on PyPI. Fun for playing, not fun for production. Fortunately the nice Plone people have created a bunch of version pins for us, so we just need to use them: [buildout] extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.0a3/versions.cfg versions = versions parts = instance find-links = http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/PILwoTk-1.1.6.4.tar.gz [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance user = admin:admin eggs = PILwoTk Plone If you are completely new to buildout and you are thinking to yourself right now \"what in the world is this guy talking about?\" then you will likely want to install buildout first so you can join in the fun. Fortunately, the nice Python people have made that easy with a package called Distribute . Following their instructions, you can do this: $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py $ python distribute_setup.py Then: $ easy_install zc.buildout $ mkdir plone $ cd plone $ buildout init After which you will have a buildout.cfg file, and you can follow along with the above steps. Happy? The best part about all of this is that (on a fast internet connection) it should only be a matter of minutes before you are able to do this: $ bin/instance fg and be staring at a thing of beauty. Of course, if you are running in the foreground (recommended for debugging) you should see something like this: aclark@Alex-Clarks-MacBook-Pro:~/Developer/public-plone/ > bin/instance fg /Users/aclark/Developer/public-plone/parts/instance/bin/runzope -X debug-mode=on 2010-01-07 12:07:56 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Thu Jan 7 12:07:56 2010 Hostname: 0.0.0.0 Port: 8080 2010-01-07 12:08:14 INFO Zope Ready to handle requests If you'd like to get a little less noisy and skip debug mode but still run in the foreground, you can use April 2008's famous addition to plone.recipe.zope2instance: aclark@Alex-Clarks-MacBook-Pro:~/Developer/public-plone/ > bin/instance console Sweet, blissful, silent running Plone.

I've learned enough Plone since then to know that I hardly know anything! Toward the end of 2009, I begin to realize that I was doing way too much, and not getting anything done as a result. So I began offloading services wherever I could to free or low cost service providers; I can't tell you how much happier I have been since then. Interestingly, after waffling over the use of these services for years, when push came to shove I had no problem choosing the right tool for the job. It didn't matter so much what selection I made. The fact that I offloaded the responsibility was the most important thing. Which brings me back to the subject at hand. I love Plone . I think it is great software. I want to make it better. In order to do that I need to broaden my horizons and use the right tool for the job, and hopefully bring those experiences back to Plone! Hence, introducing my new Wordpress-powered blog about Plone. I'm still using Plone for aclark.net (of course). I just don't want to \"manage\" the blog software anymore. I want it done for me so I can focus on other things. Since WordPress is so obviously the leading \"best\" weblog software, it was an easy decision to make. (Of course, this blog was shipped using Python software .) Lastly, I'll say this. I want to be more prolific in 2010, and I'm hoping that using the right tool for the job will help me achieve that.

It's an acquired taste, but once you get the hang of it you can use your powerful skills to create some very impressive sites – and make the world a better place like Veda and the crew at Groundwire are doing (formerly ONE/Northwest). Furthermore, If you are interested in Plone and how Plone theming works, this book is almost certainly for you. It gives you an over abundance of present day theming knowledge, and also covers aspects of the Zope 3 component architecture, where Plone has been, and where it is going to be in the not-so-distant-future. Since PACKT are well known for giving back to the communities that produce the software that is the subject of their books, purchasing a copy of this book will directly benefit Plone, so I encourage you to do so. With all that out of the way, I'd like to focus on a chapter by chapter review ( like everyone else does ) of Plone 3 Theming. Like I said, I really liked this book so please don't take any of my (hopefully constructive) criticism negatively. I hope my comments will help the readers of this book, as well as Veda, if she dares to attempt a 2nd edition one day! STANDARD DISCLAIMERS APPLY : I'm a \"paid\" reviewer (in that I received a free copy of the book) and also, I know Veda personally. Chapter 1 This chapter gives an overview of Plone, which as a total-Plone-fanboy, I very much appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the \"community lore\". \"what is Plone\", and \"books about Plone\" sections. The author also includes a \"Plone vs. Drupal\" comparison and an \"evolution\" section that covers Plone theming-framework changes version by version, which I didn't care for as much [1]. Chapter 2 This chapter lists many tools for graphic design, web browsing, web development (with browser add-ons), and text editing. All useful information. I particularly enjoyed the recommendation for the browser add-on YSlow which I'd heard of, but don't use regularly. Recommendations for the traditional UNIX® text editors vi and emacs were missing, but folks that use these editor already know which one they prefer (*wink* – vi), and those that don't aren't likely to start using them now. Chapter 3 Here we get into the now-venerable zc.buildout and how it is used by Plone. I think many folks will appreciate the terminology section, featuring definitions of Zope, Python, and various Python package terminology. I would have liked to have seen the PyPI features of plone.org mentioned , but I'll settle for a shameless plug of it here. Similarly, no mention of git or mercurial in a section about version control (Subversion only), but I suppose (again) those familiar with these technologies already know which one they prefer. Lastly, I liked the variety of approaches described in the \"download Plone\" section, from using platform installers to using the unified installer to satisfying all the Plone dependencies by hand. All good information. Chapter 4 Using ZopeSkel to create a theme package, then adding that package to your buildout as a \"develop egg\" are the main topics covered here. (A side note: I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming release of ZopeSkel 2.14! http://www.coactivate.org/projects/zopeskel-bbq-sprint/blog/2009/10/13/zopeskel-bbq-sprint-days-two-three-and-four/ ) Chapter 5 I like this chapter because it covers a variety of the TTW (through the web) changes that we are consistently reminded we are not supposed to make, but we all know that everyone makes them. The truth is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with TTW changes if you take them for what they are worth. It's fine to turn a knob or two TTW, just be aware that at some point you may be turning that knob again TTW, if you don't turn a similar knob on the file system ;-) Chapter 6-7 Here we get into various Zope 3 concepts: ZCML, browser layers, resources, viewlets and more! If there is such a thing, this would be the \"unfortunate\" part of the modern Plone theming story. Plone themers, for better or worse, must be familiar these concepts in order to be successful. One pet peave I have, that I will mention here because it seems appropriate, is the bundling of GenericSetup in a discussion about Zope 3 concepts. While GenericSetup may use Zope 3 technology under the hood (I assume it does, like most modern Zope 2 code) as a concept it has absolutely nothing to do with Zope 3 (in other words it is not part of the \"component architecture\") It just happened to be introduced to Plone around the same time various other Zope 3 technology was introduced (via Five), hence people tend to include it in the \"things they hate about Zope 3 in Plone\" category. Perhaps GenericSetup should have been added either before or after the Zope 3 stuff to make it more palatable, but that train has sailed and now we must deal with the consequences. Chapter 8 This chapter about TAL (template attribute language) is great stuff. TAL is one of those beautiful technologies that pays for itself once you learn it (unlike various web form frameworks, for example ;-). If like me you can't get enough of TAL from Veda's book, check out the section on it in the Zope 2 book: http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/ZPT.html Chapter 9-11 Here we get to watch Veda design, build, and deploy a theme. This is the focal point of the book, and is worth the price of admission alone. I almost wish the entire book was about this theme, with the other relevant bits sprinkled in as needed. But in any event, these three chapters are what most readers will be most interested in. Chapter 12 This is a great little chapter about various add-ons that themers may find interesting. My favorite add-on mentioned in this chapter is Products.FSDump. Very, very useful tool for getting various bits out of your ZODB and on to your file system (e.g. the contents of the portal_skins/custom folder). I'm really hoping that a 1.0 release will see the light of day one of these days. I notice Veda didn't mention it, but there is now an egg-based version of this popular add-on: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.FSDump/FSDump-0.9.4 Just add Products.FSDump to your instance section's eggs= parameter and off you go. Chapter 13 Here, a gratuitous chapter on multimedia wherein various useful multi-media add-ons are mentioned. I say gratuitous because I think there is a misperception that you need these add-ons to accomplish what you want. Plone should do a much better job convincing people that while it is a complex application, a Plone site is also just a website. So if you know how to do it elsewhere (e.g. on a \"regular\" website) it should be easy to do it in Plone (we are not quite there yet). Anyway, some great add-ons are mentioned here of course, but one noticeable absence: http://plone.org/products/collective-fancyzoomview (which is used by PloneSoftwareCenter on plone.org). Chapter 14 An 'Amen!' for this chapter that covers deploying and contributing themes, especially on the contributing part. As I mentioned earlier, I would have liked to have seen the PyPI features of plone.org mentioned in this book, and in this chapter in particular. While it is arguably still hard to create Plone themes, it is encouragingly not hard to share them! Also, an incredibly useful tool for releasing themes (and any package) to both plone.org/products and pypi.python.org at the same time (i.e in a single command) is http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jarn.mkrelease/2.0.2. Chapter 15 This chapter (by Alexander Limi) introduces people to \"new style\" theming with xdv. While I enjoy this subject tremendously, I think it's going to take a while before it is fully digested by integrators. Hopefully, Alex's chapter will help. I'm also told that Laurence Rowe has been making some improvements to collective.xdv recently, and I see there is a new version here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.xdv (I think this version handles 404s). Bottom line: this is great stuff but potentially confusing in that you have an add-on, collective.xdv, that applies an XSLT transform \"on the fly\" (in memory) to your Plone site, but the recommended deployment strategy is to use NGINX or Apache with Laurence's patches applied. I've spent some time doing this (I expect to re-launch this site with xdv soon, and of course plone.org uses it) and it is non-trivial to say the least. What we have now is a situation where folks are starting to use collective.xdv and thinking that *it* is the new way to theme, when in fact it is only part of the story. One last pet peeve I will mention is that both \"theming\" and \"skinning\" were used to describe the subject of the book. I would have preferred just \"theming\" (since that is what we are calling it now ;-). In conclusion, great job Veda! Thank you very much for your efforts. I look forward to reviewing a second edition. To every one else, I invite you to purchase your copy of this book and get your Plone 3 theming ON: http://www.packtpub.com/plone-3-theming-create-flexible-powerful-professional-templates [1] Quite frankly, I think Plone is in a category all its own (as the most successful Python-based CMS of all time), and while there are certainly comparisons to be made, and lessons to be learned from the competition, I think we should let the readers decide for themselves how Plone stacks up to the competition.","tags":"Blog","title":"Review of Veda Williams&#039; Plone 3 Theming"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2009/06/18/a-sane-buildout-for-repozezope2-plone/","text":"(This is also a follow-up of sorts to Martin Aspeli's excellent introduction to repoze and Plone from last year .) A Tale of Two Buildouts There are two stories going on here, both of which Martin Aspeli recently described in great detail and Chris McDonough tackled last year . For the purposes of this blog entry, I'll refer to the issue as the \"index vs. find-links\" conundrum in buildout (find-links in buildout are equivalent to distribution_links in setuptools). For those that want strict repeatability, using the index parameter is the clear winner. It simply forces buildout to do the right thing now and forever, by limiting what packages it can select from. For those that want functionality and don't mind the occasional egg-out-of-whack (i.e. unexpected upgrade), then using the find-links parameter can provide a \"sexy\" way to get decent results quickly (but may, and probably will, shoot you in the foot later). Sexy, but Dangerous Let's start with the sexy, but with less repeat-ability method first. Using this method we are not specifying our own index. Therefore you are free to add any package from PyPI or plone.org as you see fit. This is essentially why people like this method (the counter argument is that it is simple to add any additional egg you may want to your index, but we'll get to that later). So a simple buildout using this method might look like this: virtualenv plone; cd plone bin/easy_install zc.buildout bin/buildout init Edit buildout.cfg: [buildout] extends = # Using Martin Aspeli's good-py, thanks! http://good-py.appspot.com/release/repoze.zope2/1.0 http://dist.plone.org/release/3.3rc3/versions.cfg versions = versions find-links = http://dist.repoze.org/zope2/latest http://dist.repoze.org/zope2/dev/ http://dist.plone.org/release/3.3rc3 parts = instance[instance] recipe = zc.recipe.egg dependent-scripts = true eggs = repoze.zope2 Plone PIL 4. bin/buildout A few more steps are required, which we could certainly automate in buildout, but for now I'll just list them here: bin/mkzopeinstance bin/addzope2user admin admin Now, the moment we've all been waiting for… the fun part! bin/paster serve etc/zope2.ini You should see something like: [aclark@alex-clarks-macbook-pro]~/Developer/plone% bin/paster serve etc/zope2.ini 2009-06-18 22:52:24 INFO Marshall libxml2-python not available.

Of course, we did a sloppy job here, creating the Zope2 instance in the root of the buildout, etc. It is possible that plone.recipe.zope2install may help us in the future by supporting repoze.zope2 instances (or maybe it does already, I didn't try). Next up? Boring, but Repeatable I kid, but this is actually a very serious concern for many people, and rightfully so. The notion that your buildout will work the same today as it does in one year from now may be a strict requirement for your project. If it is, we can accommodate you (I hope) with the \"index\" buildout that follows. The downside is that *you* can't control what I put in the index. However, you can certainly create your own index using this technique. An arguably even simpler buildout using this technique might look like this: virtualenv plone; cd plone bin/easy_install zc.buildout bin/buildout init Edit buildout.cfg: [buildout] index = http://dist.plone.org/experimental/release/3.3rc3/simple/ parts = instance[instance] recipe = zc.recipe.egg dependent-scripts = true eggs = repoze.zope2 Plone PIL 4. bin/buildout 5. bin/mkzopeinstance 6. bin/addzope2user admin admin 7. bin/paster serve etc/zope2.ini In Conclusion Depending on what my needs are, I might choose either of these techniques. We can also hold out for multi-index support in setuptools . That would seemingly make everyone happy. In the meantime, I can tell you I'd definitely reach for a buildout sans custom index first, then ask questions later (i.e. wait for bleeding toes) but that is just me. If people find the \"index\" technique generally useful, I'd be willing to support package sheperding and index generating with basketweaver . Just let me know. If it really catches on, we could rename http://dist.plone.org/experimental/release/3.3rc3/ to http://dist.plone.org/repoze/release/3.3rc3/ . Of course, if anyone objects to this or finds it confusing, I can just as easily remove it (from dist.plone.org). Special thanks to Chris McDonough and Martin Aspeli for helping me scratch my itch! Finally, please don't rely on any of this \"in production\" yet unless you know what you are doing. I tested these techniques up to the point of starting Zope (via paste) and adding a Plone site, nothing more! :-) I, however, am getting a new server next week and will be hosting this site on repoze.zope2 very shortly ;-)","tags":"Blog","title":"A sane buildout for repoze.zope2 + Plone?"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2009/04/21/a-lamp-buildout-for-wordpress-and-other-php-apps/","text":"A buildout for PHP? Having been a Plone Consultant for many years now, I find it very painful to deal with non-Python-based technologies and I often will go to great lengths to avoid it. I recently had to deploy a new PHP application on an older Linux server (RHEL3) and could not bring myself to compile the packages, search for RPMs, or do any of the mundane, boring tasks required; so I began to look for an alternative. Enter: the LAMP buildout . I created and used this to deploy my client's PHP application. I hope others find it useful, both as an alternative way to deploy PHP apps, and as an example of the wide variety of things buildout can be used to do. It's just that simple? Unfortunately, this was not the blissful experience I had hoped for. There were some non-obvious configuration parameters that had to be dealt with. This was tedious and sometimes painful, but achieving the end result was a uniquely rewarding experience I can assure you! In fact, most of the problems had to do with the individual software components and not buildout itself, which was a pleasure to work with and one of the main reasons I am writing this blog entry. In a Plone buildout for example, in most cases, the tedious parts are handled for you and you just need to add the Plone egg, run buildout, and start your site . Break it down Now, on to the buildout! It was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.5 then deployed to RHEL3. I had a small problem on RHEL3 with the GD imaging library so I removed it (and installed it by hand in /usr/local). Other than that, things went smoothly and I deployed several PHP apps with it just for kicks, including: Phorum SugarCRM WordPress phpMyAdmin It builds Apache, PHP, MySQL, GD, and Supervisor. Let's take a look. First, we define the parts. For each of these, we'll do something useful to contribute to the end result.

Let's say you have a Plone 3 site, and for some location /foo/bar/baz, you want 'baz' and everything below it to look different. I made this change through the web because I was in a hurry, but the same can be done in filesystem code. The steps are: 1. Override getSectionFromURL (navigate to portal_skins/plone_scripts/getSectionFromURL and customize) Normally, this bit of code returns the section id for whatever section you are in. So if your site has three top level folders A, B, C, getSectionURL returns section-A when you are inside of A, section-B when you are inside of B, and so on. However, when you are inside of a sub-section, e.g. /A/news-items-folder, it *still* returns the section id, in this case section-A. The override makes getSectionURL return the sub-section, e.g. /A/news-items-folder, or /foo/bar/baz. # Courtesy of jonb at onenw.org# getSectionFromURLcontentPath = context.portal_url.getRelativeContentPath(context)if not contentPath: return Noneelse: s = '' sectionId = '' for pathItem in contentPath: sectionId += pathItem + '-' s += 'section-' + sectionId[:-1] + ' ' return s[:-1] 2. Override plone.logo (navigate to /portal_view_customizations/zope.interface.interface-plone.logo and customize) For some reason (good or not, I don't know) Plone includes an image tag in the html code it uses to generate the Plone logo. This means that it will always output something like: img src=\"logo.jpg\" which is a problem if you want to placefully replace the logo because there is no easy way to do it (perhaps you could use some trick to return a different image file with the same file name). Plone ships with: <a metal:define-macro=\"portal_logo\" id=\"portal-logo\" accesskey=\"1\" tal:attributes=\"href view/navigation_root_url\" i18n:domain=\"plone\"> <img src=\"logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" tal:replace=\"structure view/logo_tag\" /></a> Replace that with: <div metal:define-macro=\"portal_logo\" id=\"portal-logo\"> <a accesskey=\"1\" tal:attributes=\"href view/navigation_root_url\" i18n:domain=\"plone\"></a></div> 3. Add CSS (Navigate to /portal_skins/plone_styles/ploneCustom.css and customize) Next, add in some CSS to make use of the previous two changes: body.section-foo-bar-baz { background-image: url(gradient.png);}.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-globalnav li a { border: 0px; background: #0066CC; color: white; font-size: 110%; font-face: bold;}.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-globalnav { background: #0066CC; padding: 0.25em;}.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-breadcrumbs,.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-personaltools { background: white;}.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-top { background: white;}.section-foo-bar-baz #portal-logo { margin: 1em; background-image: url(ama_logo.gif); background-repeat: no-repeat;}.section-foo-bar-baz #visual-portal-wrapper { background: white; margin: auto; width: 883px; position: relative;}.section-foo-bar-baz body { background-image: url(gradient.png); background-repeat: repeat;}#portal-logo { margin: 1em; background-image: url(logo.jpg); background-repeat: no-repeat;}#portal-logo a { display: block; width: 650px; height: 80px;} I hope this helps someone get started with placeful theming.","tags":"Blog","title":"Placeful Theming"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2008/05/22/ploneorg-upgrade-remote-sprint/","text":"Join us this Saturday in irc://irc.freenode.net#PxC (channel reserved for discussion of PloneHelpCenter/PloneSoftwareCenter) at 4:00AM EDT to work on Plone.org upgrade issues, including: Deploying the latest PloneSoftwareCenter code to new.plone.org and testing collective.dist against new.plone.org/products.

Here's why: Starting and stopping Zope and ZEO separately is no fun. Using Supervisor is easy and fun. Here's how to do it: Add a part to your buildout.cfg file (this is the fun part): parts = ... supervisor ... [supervisor] recipe = zc.recipe.egg egg = supervisor Create a configuration file (this is not as fun; we need a recipe for this!) in your buildout called etc/supervisord.conf and add the following (cargo-cult style): [inet_http_server]port=127.0.0.1:9999#username=admin#password=admin[supervisord]logfile=%(here)s/../var/log/supervisord.loglogfile_maxbytes=50MBlogfile_backups=10loglevel=infopidfile=%(here)s/../var/supervisord.pidnodaemon=false[rpcinterface:supervisor]supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface[supervisorctl]serverurl=http://127.0.0.1:9999[program:zeo]command = %(here)s/../parts/zeo/bin/runzeopriority = 10[program:zope]command = %(here)s/../parts/instance/bin/runzopepriority = 20redirect_stderr = true (Uncomment the admin lines if you want to password protect your supervisor.) That's it! Now you can run buildout as normal: bin/buildout and then start supervisor: bin/supervisord and then use supervisorctl to start and stop your Zope and ZEO at the same time (for fun and profit): bin/supervisorctl start allbin/supervisorctl stop all You even get a nice web interface for free. How cool is that? Incidentally, one thing I have always found confusing is how to stop supervisord: bin/supervisorctl shutdown So as you can see I'm happy about this, but what would make me even happier is: A buildout recipe that generates a supervisord.conf file 'on the fly' (i.e. when buildout runs). A paster template that includes Supervisor and ZEO (perhaps a cross between plone_hosting and plone3_buildout?). A Unified Installer that includes Supervisor. A port of Supervisor to Windows (/me ducks). Thoughts?

I really appreciate it and being able to work closely with Tarek Ziadé and Matthew Wilkes on PloneSoftwareCenter and PloneOrg was amazing, productive, and fun. Of course being in the company of all the sprinters was a pleasure, and thank you Christophe for the hospitality! The sprint was \"successful\" in that we got a lot done. See: http://dev.plone.org/plone/log/PloneOrg/buildouts/trunk/devel and http://dev.plone.org/collective/log/Products.PloneSoftwareCenter/branches-tarek-distutils-ids for the details. In short, Matthew and Tarek worked on getting PloneSoftwareCenter ready to host eggs. I worked on creating and configuring the new site instance. Steve McMahon and I egg-i-fied the remaining product dependencies. Unfortunately, there is still a lot more to do: We need help with ExternalStorage . The problem is too many objects in the ZODB with too many different filesystem paths. In the worst case scenario I can script a fix to set a new filesystem path for the existing objects, but I'm hoping to avoid this. Ideally we'll support a pluggable storage feature that will allow end users to choose between blob, ExternalStorage, and FileSystemStorage, etc. We need to finish the new PloneSoftwareCenter implementation. See http://dev.plone.org/collective/log/collective.psc.mirroring for more information. We need to test the new PloneSoftwareCenter implementation.

I have been working on the various bits and pieces needed to upgrade for months, including: Testing the \"live\" Data.fs against the latest release of Plone. Converting old-style Zope 2 Products to eggs. Rallying the troops to contribute as needed. Becoming a plone.org admin so I can drive the process myself. and much, much more! And I can promise you that tremendous progress will be made at the Paris sprint next week, including: Finalization of the dist-utils enabled PloneSoftwareCenter that will be used. Adding blob support to PloneSoftwareCenter (Witsch, can you help? :-)) Migrating all PSCFile objects from ExternalStorage to blob. So please, if you would like to see an upgraded plone.org as much as I would, please consider making a generous donation to my travel fund. I'd like to raise around $1000 to get reimbursed for my airfare only; I will be sleeping on a donated couch. The suggested donation amount is $50-100, but any amount is welcome. Thank you all very much!!! And thanks to everyone that has helped with the upgrade so far including but not limited to: Limi, Wiggy, SteveM, Tarek, Maurits, Newbery, Jens, Witsch, MattBowen! Lastly, I promise to: Cut the fundraiser off as soon as I reach my goal, and Report back with results by the end of the month.

It's \"fixed\"! Thousands of former FVWM users can now rejoice as they enjoy sane desktop pager functionality. As you know, I've been tracking the development of the \"Spaces... Spaces... Spaces...\" hack (read: waiting for it to support 10.5.2) and I just noticed that the issue has actually been resolved by Apple, yay! See this post on macosxhints.com for more information: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2008021122525348 The short of it is, to alter the annoying spaces-follows-application behavior, do this: % defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO % sudo killall Dock Now Plonistas everywhere (including Tomster) can give Spaces another try! And now, with my sincerest thanks to Apple, I leave you to go work in another Space...","tags":"Blog","title":"Spaces fixed!"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2008/03/06/unix-tips-for-the-elderly/","text":"With apologies to the Plone community for the off-topic post, I'd like to mention this so I won't forget it again (and, in case I do some nice Plonista somewhere wil remind me ;-). I often want to do *something* to a bunch of files on the filesystem, e.g. find Music/ | xargs -J % echo 'Do something to ' % The problem is that sometimes the filenames have spaces in them which will cause: $ find Music/ | xargs -J % 'Do something to ' % xargs: unterminated quote Useless. The best fix I've managed to come up with (which I couldn't recall, hence the blog post) is to replace the beginning and end of the line with quotes to make the shell happy, e.g. $ find Music/ | sed -e 's/&#94;/\"/' -e 's/$/\"/' \"Music//iTunes/iTunes Music/Yael Naïm/Yael Naïm/03 New Soul.m4a\" So I can do things like: $ find Music/ | sed 's/&#94;/\"/' | sed 's/$/\"/' | xargs -J % ls -d % Music//iTunes/iTunes Music/Yael Naïm/Yael Naïm/03 New Soul.m4a or $ find Music/ | sed 's/&#94;/\"/' | sed 's/$/\"/' | xargs -J % file % Music//iTunes/iTunes Music/Yael Naïm/Yael Naïm/03 New Soul.m4a: ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, iTunes AAC-LC ... and afterwards go back to whatever I was supposed to be working on in the first place. There, I feel better now! Thanks for listening, :-) P.S. If anyone knows a better way to do this, please add it in the comments.","tags":"Blog","title":"UNIX Tips for the Elderly"},{"url":"http://blog.aclark.net/2008/01/01/spaces-spaces-spaces-fix-for-spacesapp-in-mac-os-x-leopard/","text":"Like many Plone developers, I primarily develop on Mac OS X. Also, like many Plone developers I salivate over, and immediately install any updates to Mac OS X that are released, including Leopard. Overall, I have been very happy with Leopard, but there is one thing that drives me (and plenty of other people) nuts: the automatic window switching functionality in Spaces. For the unfamiliar, a common feature of UNIX desktops is the ability to easily switch between many different desktops containing many different windows. This feature is commonly referred to as a \"desktop pager\" or \"virtual desktop\", but Apple calls it Spaces. Spaces is a great application, they nearly got it right on the first try. I suspect many of the questionable features were included for the sake of soliciting new would-be power users, and/or to maintain user-friendliness, but some features conflict directly with the ability to \"power use\". For example, if I'm running a Terminal in Space 1, and I switch to (an empty) Space 2 to open another Terminal, opening the new Terminal (e.g. via Quicksilver, or Spotlight) automatically returns me to Space 1. I now have two terminals in Space 1, which is not what I want. I then have to drag this Terminal to Space 2 which is easy, but annoying. A much better approach would be to allow users to force-open a new application window in the current Space. Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. *almost* makes this happen (via some Dock + code-injection magic). With Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.., I can now switch to a new Space and open a new Terminal window, without being automatically taken to another Space running another Terminal. The only catch is the Terminal application has to be \"in focus\", else the old \"wrong\" behavior still applies. In other words, switch to a new window, then click on the Terminal icon in the Dock, then open a new Terminal window. Not a bad work-around for my purposes, this allows me to easily open as many Terminals on as many Spaces as I see fit without being \"redirected\" (read: interrupted). There are a few downsides: 1. You have to run Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. as root, not convenient for starting on boot (unless applications can be run as services somehow? Or something? :-) 2. I'd like the ability to force-launch a new window for any currently running application in the current Space without having to bring that application into focus. Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. does not currently provide this functionality. 3. It is for Intel-based Macs only. I *really* hope Apple addresses this issue in a future release, but in the meantime many thanks to the Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. developer!!! If you are similarly bothered by this behavior in Spaces, I recommend you give Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. a try.","tags":"Blog","title":"Spaces.. Spaces..

This can be a problem when using the plone.recipe.productdistros recipe because when 'Bar' is extracted to parts/productdistros/foo, it will not work. Fortunately, there is hexagonit.recipe.download , which allows you to specify a destination. For example, ZNagios (an add-on product that integrates Zope with Nagios) is available as a tarball here: http://svn.gocept.com/viewcvs/ZNagios/trunk.tar.gz?view=tar If we use productdistros, we end up with ZNagios installed in parts/productdistros/trunk. No good. But if we use hexagonit.recipe.download we can control the destination. e.g. [buildout] parts = ... znagios[znagios] recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download url = http://svn.gocept.com/viewcvs/ZNagios/trunk.tar.gz?view=tar destination = products/ZNagios strip-top-level-dir = True After running buildout, you should have the following in your buildout products/ directory: /products/ZNagios /products/ZNagios/COPYRIGHT.txt /products/ZNagios/LICENSE.txt /products/ZNagios/README.txt /products/ZNagios/__init__.py /products/ZNagios/check_zope.py /products/ZNagios/munin_client.py /products/ZNagios/version.txt /products/ZNagios/zeo_munin.py /products/ZNagios/zope.cfg As always, there are better ways to do this but getting it done is nice too.

Most of the information came from Chris Calloway , I just converted it to structured text. Now it's better than the old one and should be easier for \"humans\" to maintain. As Chris would say, \"Yay us.\" What I continue to find amazing is: The number of user groups that have come and gone over the years. The number of user group unification attempts that have come and gone over the years. I don't really have a point, other than to say that http://www.zope.org/Resources/UserGroups looks a lot like http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups and http://plone.org/support/local-user-groups , and to me that is A Good Thing ™. It suggests that: We are all fighting the same battle, i.e. we all like using Python to solve the world's problems. We really have entered into the fourth age of Zope , i.e. Zope is becoming part of the Python vernacular again, and not in a bad way. There is still more work to be done, e.g. Chris Calloway once told me he didn't believe in using a \"Super Robot Chicken\" (Web 2.0 euphemism?) to unite all of the user groups under one umbrella, but I am still holding my breath!

Finally, here it is. But this is not the blog entry I had originally intended to write. There were some grandiose ideas about where I first heard of it; the blog entry that inspired me to try it; how I was frustrated with the alternatives; none of these are present here in any detail. That is because I'm frustrated with the length of time it takes to write a \"quality\" blog entry, when all I want to do is get the information out. (But that is a separate blog entry :-)) To that end, here are a few things I'd like you to know about *slrn* : It rocks, for those that enjoy terminal applications as I do (e.g. mutt, w3m, etc.) And by \"rocks\" I mean, it allows you to do in a terminal what most people do in a graphical application. Further, it allows you to do it the way you want (for the most part) and by that I mean, it allows you to bind keys to actions. It's a bit confusing to get started, that is what I'd like to help with here. There is a default config file that you'll want to copy to ~/.slrnrc , and there are some additional configuration parameters I use that were hard to track down. Those are: set confirm_actions 14visible_headers \"From:,Subject:,Newsgroups:,Followup-To:,Reply-To:,Date:\"set query_read_group_cutoff 0set uncollapse_threads 1set netiquette_warnings 0 Most of these are self-explanatory, but if you are looking at \"set confirm_actions 14\" and thinking \"wtf?\" you are not alone :-) I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to explore. See: http://slrn.sourceforge.net/manual/slrn-manual.html for more information.
