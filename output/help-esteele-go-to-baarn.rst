A few years back, I was `invited to the Baarn UI Sprint 2007.`_ This was
a huge turning point for me and Plone. Having just attended the `annual
conference in Seattle`_, I was raring to contribute. And in getting
invited, I felt like a Catholic getting invited to the Vatican to hang
out with the Pope (well 1/2 the Pope at least, aka `Limi`_ ;-)). You
cannot beat the awesomeness of the Plone community and the fact that if
you give something to it, you will get it back ten-fold in:

-  Knowledge and skills (You can acquire a ton of technical skill by
   learning the Plone).
-  Kindness from strangers (People will help you do things, like attend
   a development sprint in another country, amazing).
-  Employment for life (There is more Plone work than there are Plone
   developers, and I don't see this changing anytime soon).

Which brings me to the subject at hand. One of our own, Eric Steele
(author of the amazing development tool `Gloworm`_, and member of the
extremely Plone friendly web group called `WebLion`_) needs your help!
Last I spoke with Eric he had reached 60% of his desired goal, so let's
help him get to the finish line (by Wednesday).

You can (and probably should, if you can afford it ;-) donate a little
something here:

I can imagine only good things to come for Plone as a result of Eric
attending this event (in fact, Weblion is funding the trip, donations
are for food and incidentals if I recall correctly).

So please help! :-D
