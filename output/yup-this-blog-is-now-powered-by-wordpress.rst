Yup, this blog is now powered by WordPress.

**(Or, "How I learned to stop worrying and use the right tool for the
job.")** My first blog entry was `well over two years ago`_. I've
learned enough Plone since then to know that I hardly know anything!
Toward the end of 2009, I begin to realize that I was doing way too
much, and not getting anything done as a result. So I began offloading
services wherever I could to free or low cost service providers; I can't
tell you how much happier I have been since then. Interestingly, after
waffling over the use of these services for years, when push came to
shove I had no problem choosing the right tool for the job. It didn't
matter so much what selection I made. The fact that I offloaded the
responsibility was the most important thing. Which brings me back to the
subject at hand. I love `Plone`_. I think it is great software. I want
to make it better. In order to do that I need to broaden my horizons and
use the right tool for the job, and hopefully bring those experiences
back to Plone! Hence, introducing my new Wordpress-powered blog
**about** Plone. I'm still using Plone for `aclark.net`_ (of course). I
just don't want to "manage" the blog software anymore. I want it done
for me so I can focus on other things. Since WordPress is so obviously
the leading "best" weblog software, it was an easy decision to make. (Of
course, this blog was shipped using `Python software`_.) Lastly, I'll
say this. I want to be more prolific in 2010, and I'm hoping that using
the right tool for the job will help me achieve that. It has worked
wonders so far.
