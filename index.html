</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>With Diazo theming on the rise (going in to 4.3 core) I'd like to take a look at the Diazo theming ecosystem again. For that matter, since I know that some folks will never commit to Diazo, I'd like to take a look at the entire Plone theming ecosystem.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-themes">
<h2>What are themes?</h2>
<p>Themes control the way the site looks. For the scope of this post, at least, I don't care about &quot;views&quot;, &quot;viewlets&quot;, &quot;portlets&quot;, &quot;tiles&quot;, etc. In fact, I'm not sure I ever want to mix &quot;templating&quot; (for lack of a better word) with theming. There is a bit of discussion going on right now amongst the core developers regarding how to make it easier for themers to associate there template code with application code. And while I fully support this discussion, at present the bottom line is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Old style&quot;<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a> theming is still a valid way to control the look and feel of a Plone system.</li>
<li>&quot;New style&quot; (Diazo) theming is a great way to isolote the complexity of the stack and get HTML/CSS/JavaScript folks going quickly (especially in 4.3a1 with the new theme editor!)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-are-themes">
<h2>Where are themes?</h2>
<p>In short: all over the place. Why is that? Because we are in the middle of several fluctuating &quot;best practice&quot; approaches that have fluctuated over the past half decade or so:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Plone developers should release their Plone add-ons <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a> to PyPI!</li>
<li>Plone developers should release their Plone add-ons to plone.org (in addition to PyPI)!</li>
<li>Plone developers should release their Diazo themes as zip archives (i.e. no Python package)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the need for this post to clarify the status quo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-should-i-do">
<h2>What should I do?</h2>
<p>Everyone should form their own opinion based on the information in this post and act accordingly or however they see fit. If we can all agree on an approach, great! If not, here's what I'm doing.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-am-i-doing">
<h3>What am I doing?</h3>
<p>While I have a large interest in seeing plone.org work well (and am also in the middle of helping to cat herd a plone.com marketing site effort), I have given up on plone.org as a reliable, consistent source for add-ons (in favor of PyPI). This abandonment is perhaps only temporary, but in any event for now: if it's on PyPI, it's good enough for me. Also to close the loop on Diazo zip themes, while I fully support this approach I don't use it myself much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-point">
<h3>What is the point?</h3>
<p>All of this brings me to the actual point of this post which is to take a quick look at the Plone themeing landscape in order to spur more Diazo theme development (or old style theming, if that is your thing). Quickly, using pip to search PyPI by package namespace I see:</p>

<p>That last one is a surprise, and that's a total of <strong>154 themes for Plone on PyPI</strong> (assuming I didn't miss any which I probably did). If we had the man power, all of these themes could be made to work with the latest Plone and work with either old style or new style technology. So if we can't do that (which is a hugely ambitious goal) let's at least try to come close!</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>It's getting harder to define what &quot;old style&quot; theming is. For this blog entry, old style theming is some form of customizing the main_template in Plone (I'm ignoring the fact that macros called by main_template are customizable, for now). If we could (consistently, in a core supported way) get newer ways to do that (e.g. browser views instead of CMF skin layers) then &quot;old style&quot; would become &quot;newer style&quot;. It wouldn't become &quot;new style&quot; because Diazo technology is &quot;newer&quot; than browser view technology. Get it? I think my point is this: in addition to seeing Diazo help with isolating the complexity of the stack, I'd like to see the underlying technology modernized. Give me something that looks and feels like &quot;old style&quot; theming (i.e. putting templates in CMF skin layers) but that is built on modern technology (i.e. the ZCA).</td></tr>
