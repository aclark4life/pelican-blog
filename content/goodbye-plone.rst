Goodbye Plone
=============

After experiencing an unexpectedly negative reaction in #plone to my most recent post "Introducing The Plone Kitty" (which was intended to be light-hearted and fun), I have decided to leave the Plone community for good. I wish you all the best! It's been fun.

To be clear: I'll still be doing some Plone consulting as part of my "day job" at ACLARK.NET, LLC. But I won't be participating in any community events because it has become clear to me that my vision for Plone, and the Plone Community, may be inconsistent with the vision held by the majority of the core team.
