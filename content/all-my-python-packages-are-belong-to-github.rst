*Including many Plone add-ons* Hi. My name is Alex "please don't call
them products" Clark. But you may call me aclark or aclark4life. In the
spirit of continuing the `great git migration`_, and in order to `beta
test pythonpackages.com`_, I've just moved the last of my Subversion
repositories to GitHub. This means `any package I have Owner or
Maintainer permission for on PyPI`_ now lives in one of 8 GitHub
organizations, or my personal GitHub account on github.com. Great
Success!

PLONE DEVS: Y U NO MOVE REPOS?
------------------------------

The Plone AI team has tentatively scheduled the end-of-2012 as the time
to flip `svn.plone.org/svn/collective`_ to read only (/plone and
/archetypes are already read only). So if you are still using the old
collective, please take a minute to start thinking about migrating. As
always, I'm happy to provide assistance to anyone that needs it to move
their code. (I'm in #plone on irc.freenode.net or you can email
aclark@aclark.net.)
