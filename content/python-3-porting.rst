*The 3 in 2013 is for Python 3*

I tend to like projects that everyone else **hates**, e.g.:

- Removing persistent Python objects associated with missing classes in ZODB.
- Making new releases for old software that is still useful but unmaintained.
- Running flake8 on 10s or 100s of source files and hand-fixing the results.

Part of this has to do with **repetition**. I know how to do these things, and I like doing them. Over and over. If someone says, "my Data.fs file is broken" I get excited. Anyway, I hope you get the idea.

I am your man

Which brings me to the subject of this post: **Python 3 Porting**. I've been helping out with porting the Python Imaging Library to Python 3 (via the Pillow fork). I've not written any code yet, but it strikes me as the type of thing I'd be very interested in doing professionally. So, if you or your company are in need of a "workhorse" to plow through old code and update it, `I am your man <http://aclark.net/team/alex-clark>`_. Please do `get in touch <mailto:info@aclark.net>`_.

What's in it for you
--------------------

Now I know what you are thinking: **porting Python 2 software to Python 3 is a lot of work for little gain**. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise, however I will tell you this:

- For me, 2013 is "the year of Python 3". I've now promised to deliver and maintain a **Python 3 compatible PIL by PyCon 2013**. I now care about Python 3 (this was not true before).
- The Python 3 Wall of Shame is now the `Python 3 Wall of Superpowers <https://python3wos.appspot.com/>`_. We are over the hump.
- Many popular Python web frameworks support or are about to support Python 3 e.g. CherryPy, Django, Pyramid.

So, there is no time like the present to **take a serious look at Python 3**.
