My focus will be `PloneSoftwareCenter (PSC)`_. That's right! You heard
it here first. After a little prodding on IRC from Martin Aspeli, Steve
McMahon, and Geir Bækholt I am declaring myself the "owner" of `PSC`_
(read: responsible for releases). I'll spend my first two days (16 hours
next Tuesday and Thursday, 9-5 EDT) working on `PSC`_ and getting it
ready to ship (with Plone 3 compatibility).
