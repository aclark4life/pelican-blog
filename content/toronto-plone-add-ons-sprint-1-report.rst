Plone.org maintenance. Here is the sprint "report out" from Jordan
Baker:

Toronto Plone Addons Sprint Report #1:
======================================

-  Attending: Robert Jackiewicz, Jordan Baker, John Southern, aclark
-  aclark helped out by answering some questions and provided a dump of
   PSC data from `plone.org`_
-  Rob was working on getting his buildout working with nginx and
   documenting the process
-  John worked on gettting a task listing setup on coactivate:
   `http://www.coactivate.org/projects/ploneorg-upgrade/tasks/tasklist/show/993`_
-  Jordan commited changes to allow for filtering by version, autosubmit
   on selection change and searching using the PSC view instead of the
   Plone search view.  aclark is working on cutting a release...
   hopefully we can get a preview soon..

Outstanding questions:
----------------------

-  need some help with c.xdv or nginx so we can preview changes in the
   theme
-  Where should we put our issues in the future.  There was talk of
   eating dog food using a Poi instance on `plone.org`_ -- can someone
   help me set that up (add hexsprite and gogojohn as admins)
-  Please help us by prioritizing the tasks in the task list on
   coactivate

Next Sprint:
------------

Shooting for January 22.  Hopefully that will work for most people.
Please help us spread the word to interested parties... more details to
come.
