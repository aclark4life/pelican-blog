I Reinstalled Again
===================

*A while back* `I wrote about reinstalling OS X <http://blog.aclark.net/2010/10/15/i-reinstalled-recently/>`_. *This is another one of those posts.*

I like to reinstall OS X, a lot. So much so, you'd think I'd find some way to automate the process. There must be something *soothing* about it, though, because I keep doing it.

I'm writing this post now because since my last post, I've begun storing a snippets on `gist.github.com <https://gist.github.com/aclark4life/starred>`_ to help automate the process. This way, I get "the best of both worlds": automation of the tedious parts & interaction with the fun parts.

Specifically, with El Capitan I've settled on these 4 snippets:

Preferences
-----------

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/aclark4life/3efb00b88dcacc9e0c2c.js"></script>

Homebrew
--------

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/aclark4life/11f3505fa87681581fa1.js"></script>

Python
------

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/aclark4life/69cb7c9363d79db9b3dd.js"></script>

Misc
----

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/aclark4life/594fb26860fece756a2d.js"></script>

Next, I perform various additional steps manually *either* because I've not figured out how to automate them *or* the automation prospects are not attractive:

- Security & Privacy → Allow apps downloaded from **Anywhere**
- Drag /opt to **Finder Favorites** for easy access to Homebrew Casks, then:
- Users & Groups → Login items → **Jumpcut**
- Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control → Move left a space → ⌘ ←
- Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control → Move right a space → ⌘ →

Still, I'd trade all these steps for full automation if I could find an approach that's not more tedious than cut & pasting the above.

Lastly, I hope this helps someone. Please add a comment below if you have a better approach.
