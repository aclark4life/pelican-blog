The website for Python egoists™
-------------------------------

I have this overwhelming desire to know how many times my favorite Python packages have been downloaded. Don't you? If so, look no further than `pythonpackages.com`_.

Count downloads
---------------

Where you can enter a package like `Django`_ and find out the number of downloads.

Count favorites
---------------

Or click on **Count favorites** to reveal how many times it has been favorited.

Find trash
----------

Or even poke some good natured fun at it, for its `failure to provide adequate package metadata`_.

Discuss packages
----------------

You can even *discuss*\ packages on `pythonpackages.com`_.

Recent activity
---------------

But wait there is more! You can also browse the `latest changelog activity`_ from PyPi right on the site.

Package info
------------

Lastly, if you get bored counting package downloads and favorites you can look at the *actual* `package metadata`_.

Conclusion
----------

Sound interesting? Or utterly silly, perhaps? I think `pythonpackages.com`_ is the best of both. It started off as a front end to the command line utility `vanity`_, but has taken on a life of it's own.

After a small run on Python reddit and Hacker News, I'm looking forward to seeing what Python Planet folks think. So please check out `pythonpackages.com`_ and let me know. You can leave comments about the site here.
