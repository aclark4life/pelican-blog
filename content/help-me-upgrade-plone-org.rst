You may be wondering why plone.org is not running the latest version of
Plone. Well wonder no more! By the end of this month, it will be. I have
been `working on`_\ the various bits and pieces needed to upgrade for
months, including:

-  Testing the "live" Data.fs against the latest release of Plone.
-  Converting old-style Zope 2 Products to eggs.
-  Rallying the troops to contribute as needed.
-  Becoming a plone.org admin so I can drive the process myself.
-  and much, much more!

And I can promise you that tremendous progress will be made at the Paris
sprint next week, including:

-  Finalization of the dist-utils enabled PloneSoftwareCenter that will
   be used.
-  Adding blob support to PloneSoftwareCenter (Witsch, can you help?
   :-))
-  Migrating all PSCFile objects from ExternalStorage to blob.

So please, if you would like to see an upgraded plone.org as much as I
would, please consider making a generous donation to my travel fund. I'd
like to raise around $1000 to get reimbursed for my airfare only; I will
be sleeping on a donated couch. The suggested donation amount is
$50-100, but any amount is welcome. Thank you all very much!!! And
thanks to everyone that has helped with the upgrade so far including but
not limited to: Limi, Wiggy, SteveM, Tarek, Maurits, Newbery, Jens,
Witsch, MattBowen!

Lastly, I promise to:

-  Cut the fundraiser off as soon as I reach my goal, and
-  Report back with results by the end of the month.

Now without further ado, please donate-away! :-)
