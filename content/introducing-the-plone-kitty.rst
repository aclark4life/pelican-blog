*Actually: re-introducing the Plone Kitty from Plone 1!*

*Plone Kitty* is the name of a theme (then called "skin") that shipped with the earliest versions of `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ (1.1 in the image above). This was a simpler time when the web was new, and everything was possible!

Today, we know that the **web is hard**. While everything is still possible, building the web requires a tremendous amount of hard work. But it doesn't have to be all drudgery. There is still quite a bit of fun to be had building the web, if you know where to look (in addition to all the unavoidable hard work).

Enter: Plone. Both the web and Plone have changed drastically since The Plone Kitty once prowled the internet. And while the Plone Kitty is all but extinct, Plone lives on; continously modernizing itself to keep up with the fast pace of today's modern web.

From the `Plone Kitty website <http://plone-1-fun.herokuapp.com>`_ (now running on Heroku!)::

    Plone was once great. Actually, Plone is still great but the excitement around it has dissipated. It's time to fix that.

    If you used Plone "back in the day" (early 2000s), please add a comment below about your experiences then. If you are new to Plone or just curious about it now, please add a comment below about your initial impressions.

    Let's bring the excitement back to Plone in 2013!

So if you'd like to add **your bit of nostalgia**, or first impressions of Plone, `please do so here <http://plone-1-fun.herokuapp.com/#disqus>`_. I appreciate any and all comments, good or bad, about Plone.
