Regarding my recent "Goodbye Plone" post:

- It's come to my attention that the style of my departure post, and associated actions, may be perceived poorly. I'm sorry. This was not my intention, and I apologize if I've upset anyone. The Plone Community deserves the best, so let me see what I can do to address this.

- Several folks have reached out to express their concern about my departure, I appreciate this very much.

- While I stand behind my need for distance from such conflicts, I don't want to give the Plone Community or the outside world the wrong impression.

So, let me say this. I'm thinking about what happened today, and I'm going to comment about it in the future. I.E. after 24 hours or so. Regardless of future updates, please consider me: "around in some capacity, but not as fully engaged for personal reasons" :-). This is an attempt to revert my abrubt departure, while at the same time not fully re-engage until such time as I can determine the best course of action. Note that above all, and aside from my personal and professional goals, I don't want to be disruptive to other members of the community if I can help it.

Thanks for reading.
