After 9 months of development, pythonpackages.com has grand-ceremoniously flipped the switch from alpha to beta. Here is an overview of the beta release features.

**Killer GitHub integration**
-----------------------------

The workflow you may now enjoy is:

-  Login with your GitHub account
-  Select a repository that contains a Python package

One-click release
-----------------

More sweet workflow:

-  Click a button to release to a test index, PyPI

Create packages through-the-web (with PasteScript)
--------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of room for growth, but this feature is exciting even in its simplest form. 

Dashboard o releases
--------------------

pythonpackages.com keeps track of your releases, using the same technology that powers the alpha release "package featuring" feature.

GitHub Organization support
---------------------------

But wait, there's more. Paid plans (which have not been deployed yet) get access to GitHub organizations, whose repositories can then be "slotted" like normal. If you'd like to get started using the site, check out the `crash course`_.
