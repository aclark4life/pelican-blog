Lots of exciting things are happening with Plone.org!

#. `Calvin Hendryx-Parker`_ and `Six Feet Up`_ are working on moving
   \*.plone.org to one of their powerful new servers (with some
   exceptions, most notably {svn,dev}.plone.org will remain in place, as
   I understand it)!
#. `Alex Limi`_ and `company`_ are working on deploying a new look and
   feel using a new-fangled technology called xdv (a variant of
   Deliverance).
#. I am removing `kinks`_ that have been lingering after the recent
   upgrade (in theory ;-).

This blog entry is both a "call to arms" to everyone involved in
helping, and a message to everyone waiting patiently that we haven't
forgotten about you! :-D

In particular, I'd like to hear from any early adopters of the new
`http://plone.org/products`_\ section. You can read about how to use the
new PyPI functionality here, if you haven't already:
`http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.2.2`_. In my little
"test" product, I found it quite useful:
`http://plone.org/products/Products.todo/.`_

So if you are using it, I'd definitely like to hear your experiences. Or
if not, please give it a try!
