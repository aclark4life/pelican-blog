Hi all,

I just noticed that my submission to slashdot was posted (sorry, NASA
;-). Please use your mod points and/or add comments (or do whatever
slashdot people do) to promote Plone. I've sent an email asking that the
link to plone.org be restored (it was removed by the editor, probably
because I made it too big :-).
