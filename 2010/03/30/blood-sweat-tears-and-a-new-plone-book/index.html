2006</a> was my inspiration for <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/2008">Plone Conference 2008</a>, then
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.packtpub.com/Professional-Plone-web-applications-CMS/book">Professional Plone Development</a> was my inspiration for this book:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.packtpub.com/plone-3-3-site-administration/book">Plone 3.3 Site Administration</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.aclark.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/plone-site-admin.jpg">|image0|</a> For the past 14 months or so, I have been writing a book
aimed at end users of Plone; folks that have little knowledge of how to
do much more than add content. It is intended to make them feel more
comfortable performing various site administrator tasks. Topics like
theming, maintenance, and optimization are covered.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>#1</h2>
<p>This book aims to &quot;lower the Plone bar for users of Python&quot;. What do I
mean by that? Basically this: I love Python almost as much as I love
Plone. It lets me translate my thoughts directly into code. I fantasize
that with little more than a Python interpreter, one can forge a working
Plone site within minutes. But it is not just a fantasy, it is (more or
less) the status quo. (Maybe even <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver">MacGyver</a> used Python?)</p>
<p>So, this book begins at the beginning: by making sure folks are
comfortable installing and using Python on there operating system of
choice (or using the pre-installed Python). If you read <em>Professional
Plone Development</em>, you may recall Martin Aspeli saying at the beginning
of Chapter 3:</p>
<blockquote>
We will assume that Python 2.4 gets invoked when you run python on
the command line.</blockquote>
<p>This book does not make that assumption and tries to cover everything
you may need to know after installing your operating system up to that
point.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 1</strong>, we cover installing and running Python on three
popular operating systems: Mac OS X 10.6 (my main squeeze), Windows 7,
and Ubuntu 9.10 (Debian is my main production server squeeze). Other
operating systems are welcome; your mileage may vary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>#2</h2>
<p>This book is largely a response to the whole &quot;Oh no! I have to use
Buildout to install Plone and its add-ons!&quot; sentiment that has been
prevalent since Buildout was first introduced to Plone several years
ago. I don't know if Buildout was the &quot;right&quot; way to go, but I do know
that I love using it and I would like to help others feel the same way.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: Plone made a conscious decision to &quot;become more
Pythonic&quot; by using eggs. With that choice came more complexity from
potential conflicts between eggs. Buildout is one solution to that
problem. Unfortunately, it introduces other problems like cryptic error
messages and a certain <strong>too-many-moving-parts</strong>-ness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-aside">
<h2>An aside…</h2>
<p>Let me correct myself: I am fairly certain Buildout was the right way to
go at the time. What I am not sure about is where to go from here. It
would be nice to get back to a place where folks could just drop
packages in to a directory (I don't literally mean going back to
old-style products, but perhaps we could provide that type of
functionality again somehow). But I don't have an answer for that. In
the meantime, let's make everyone more comfortable with using Buildout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-rest-of-the-book">
<h2>About the rest of the book…</h2>
<p>The book teaches you to find your way around Buildout and Plone. Whether
you choose to follow along and build your site from scratch using only
Buildout (and a paper clip) or if you use one of the Buildout-based
installers (like the Unified Installer), this book aims to make you more
competent and comfortable performing a variety of Buildout-related
tasks.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapters 2-7</strong>, we present various buildout configuration files
that correspond to specific tasks that are related to various subjects,
e.g. theming, maintenance, and optimization. The reader is expected to
&quot;know how to write a buildout.cfg file&quot; by the end. No one that reads
the book is allowed in the #plone IRC channel afterward to ask about
buildout (you can answer buildout questions though). Kidding… I kid…</p>
<p>In the final <strong>Chapter 8</strong>, we cover new technologies like XDV and
repoze.zope2 which may become more mainstream once you decide to start
using them (although the latter seems more like a toy to keep us busy
until the real fix arrives: <a class="reference external" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.devel/23887">full WSGI support in Zope 2</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-will-it-arrive">
<h2>When will it arrive?</h2>
<p>PACKT originally announced the book will arrive in March and I have been
working non-stop since mid-March to make sure it gets out the door as
quickly as possible; I expect it to be available <strong>Real Soon Now™</strong>. I
apologize to those of you who have pre-ordered and are now waiting for
it!</p>
<p>So get ready! I plan to have over 200 pages of draft material submitted
by the end of this month. I will continue to work with PACKT to address
any concerns that arise during editing. They have promised to try to
ship the book by May, so we will see how it goes. I encourage you to
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.packtpub.com/plone-3-3-site-administration/book">pre-order now</a> as that will&nbsp;go a long way to inspire them to work just
that much harder to get it done and out to you, ASAP!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-write-a-book">
<h2>Can I write a book?</h2>
<p>Probably. For those curious about the process (as I very much was), here
is a bit about how it went for me:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A few years ago, Martin Aspeli had the idea for Practical Plone 3 and
put out a call to writers that I responded to; I ended up
contributing 2 chapters. This taught me that it was indeed a lot of
work, and I got exposed to the editing process.</li>
<li>A couple years ago, PACKT approached me (and several others) about
the idea for Plone Site Administration and I thought I had a good
story to tell based on my experiences, so I wrote a detailed outline
and they accepted it.</li>
<li>Though I had written for Practical Plone 3, I struggled to find my
voice. At the same time I had a tremendous amount of consulting work
to do to make a living. I sneaked in time to write drafts and
eventually found my voice. To be honest, the most productive work has
been done in the last 3 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the biggest lesson I learned was this: stop thinking and start
writing. I tend to over analyze things and spent a lot of time thinking
about &quot;how it would go&quot; rather than just writing it. Writing is the key.
Think less, write more (at which point your thoughts tends to flow more
naturally anyway).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-i-write-a-book">
<h2>Should I write a book?</h2>
<p>Possibly. I am sensitive to the phenomenon of &quot;Plone book diarrhea&quot; and
I do think that there can be such a thing as too many Plone books. But I
don't think we are there yet. To me, the more books published about
Plone (by PACKT or any publisher) the better. I like to see what each
individual author brings to the story, even if the stories they are
telling tend to overlap sometimes. So for me the answer to that question
both before and after writing my book is <strong>yes</strong>. I know I am a better
writer having written it, and I certainly know more about Python, Zope,
and Plone and many other technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-either-case-you-should-definitely-take-my-class">
<h2>In either case, you should definitely take my class.</h2>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about Python and tools like
Distribute, Pip, Buildout, etc. and you want to feel more comfortable
managing your Plone site, you will not want to miss the <a class="reference external" href="http://plone-site-admin.eventbrite.com">one day class I
am teaching at Plone Symposium East 2010</a>!</p>
<p>The book will hopefully be out by then, but the class will go on either
way.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there, and I hope you enjoy the book.</p>
